i was meaning to ask you can you please leave the electoral college. in way many people were grateful for this kind art education in many ways people use this place for so long to know how many scarefices that many people choose this area than no other. there got to be a diffrent reason to come in mind for can stop this idea from elimanating this fine place to construct for all years of hard work. for so long many people still would like to choose this college as great example for their success. this my letter to you senator. but if you refuse this than i don't know what i would do,but  what i do know is you choose what it came from your mind i can not stop you from picking the good or bad  choices but i can help you pick the right choice. as well making a election area that only happens in four years is not really worth anything many would disagree for this nonsense build and just forget what just came in mind and pick the right choice.                    ",stance,1,1

9093-O,"venus's reputation is challenging for humans to study. it's a thick atmospere of close to about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. venus is even more challenging because ther're clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in there atomospere,on their surface ther're tempature averages at about 800 degrees farenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times greater than what our scientist are experincing on our own planet. venus's conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on earth.

venus's weather has additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. an paragraph 6 sentence 1 it says that venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. also an paragraph 7 sentence 2 its says venus surface have lasted for three weeks in such condition that another project is looking back an to the old technology.

however, peering at venus on a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. more importantly, researchers cannot ttake samples of rock, gas, or anything else froma a distance.",stance,1,1

the author gives us examplse of how to tell these claims. he gives us the distinked signs to look for to back the argument. such as he tells us the facial expresions are very universal. meanig that not just one person can have that facial expresion in the world. also tells us how the new technolgy tracks the facil movements in somones face when they are showing emotions or trying to find them.

all though you think that is a good idea, ask yourself, ""what will be the effect of this decision?"". me myself have an a average and am in the top of my class, but even i do not believe that this is a good idea. if you do this no-one will care, i mean why should they if they are barely maintaining a c average just to play sports and impress their parents. for that reason then what makes you think they will keep trying.

taking away the only thing kids enjoy about school, is very bad they would probably just drop out. you're the one that caused all of this then you would be the one to blame. there would probably not even be enough kids for a full team, you would loose everything the kids actually liked about school, you will loose your players, and most importantly you would probably loose your job.

that is why you should not make students have a grade b average to perform in extracurricular activities. now i hope you make the right choice.

17756-O,"i feel like it would be a great idea to have driverless cars. why? it'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives and also it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways. and marketing would sky rocket. many people would love to travel places but they'll get lazy to drive, but if they have a car that can drive itself then it would make it better on the humans life aswell.

many people also agree on how bad it is. honestly it does have some flaws and miss happs. one of them are getting sent to a different location. just like g.p.s., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. a driverless car is like a driving g.p.s., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others.

at the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a driverless car will be one of them. so be smart and purchase one at your own risk. ",stance,1,2

while some express concerns, the potential benefits of driverless cars far outweigh any perceived drawbacks. acknowledging that technology isn't perfect, the risks associated with driverless cars are manageable and, ultimately, less dangerous than relying on human drivers. the worry about being sent to a different location, similar to g.p.s. errors, is a valid point, but these systems are constantly improving and safeguards can be implemented to prevent such mishaps. a driverless car with a malfunctioning problem, while a possibility, is not a certainty and ongoing testing and refinement will minimize these risks.

at the end of the day, technology will offer immense improvements and a driverless car will be a significant step forward. embracing this innovation, with careful consideration and continuous development, promises a safer, more efficient, and more enjoyable future for everyone. so be excited and purchase one—it's a worthwhile investment in progress.",stance,0,2

how are you? i just took some time to write you this letter you need to know about.

i am writing you a letter to describe to you i think the better policy, policy 2 one reason is because, phones are not allowed in the school in the first place, phones are a disturbing materials for class and its better to not have phones in school at all. even though school allows them to have phones students will still turn them on and use them during class. also some students use phone during reading time when they are in the library when supposable the teacher is teaching them and behind her back many kids are texting with their phones . another occasions kids usually need to be doing their work but they are instead texting. i believe policy 2 is better for the school not to allow students have phones at school at all. if you have any questions please contact me as soon as you can at phone_number

driverless car can be a bad idea because looking at technolog these days, it does alway work properly and that could lead to the cars. if some wrecks another car that would mean that it would be the cars fault but all the blame would be one the ""driver"". no one would know how it happened properly because there would be indication on how it happened.

another reason why this would be a bad reason to have drverless cars was that the speed would be the same for everyone and some people may be in a hurry to get to places and the cars would take only the main roads to get to their destination. if the car wasn't used right it would mean that many people would be in danger to reckless people in the world.

the last problem with this kind of car would be when the person in the driver seat won't pay attention to the road and they get hurt for it. many people in the world would be get hurt because they aren't doing anything and think that they would be perfectly safe and they won't.

another reason why driverless cars are a great idea is that the speed can be optimized for efficiency and safety for everyone. some people may be in a hurry to get to places and the cars can use data to find the fastest and safest route to their destination. if the car is used correctly it would mean that many people would be protected from dangerous drivers in the world.

i also think that the face is a face because such formations, while rare, *are* possible and the american west, known for its dramatic landscapes, is precisely where we might expect to find them. it is fascinating how from the front it looks like a circle, but from the side it reveals a rectangular shape – a testament to the complex geological processes at play. the fact that we ended up revealing that it was infact a face only strengthens my conviction.

there is good thing about the self driven car, but do these changes really matter? if all of us decide to switch over that the self driven car will it run on gasoline like the car that we have today. if they didn't that would destroy other countires that sell potrolium and that would lead them to lower the price and workers won't get paid as much and many work will end up losing their job. self driven cars aren't all that self driven because they need to be driven when there is construction or a accident. most big states don't allow the self driven car. beaucse if someone gets injured or even killed who will be the one taking the responsibility the drive or the manufacture?

i would like to express my strong support for preserving the electoral college for many important purposes. the electoral college ensures a structured process for becoming president, and frankly, some of the people voting don't truly understand how that process works. the electors are the ones to elect the president, and while people’s votes are incredibly valuable, they directly shape the selection of those electors.

the electoral college provides a necessary framework because many citizens don't fully grasp the intricacies of becoming president. imagine the chaos if we simply allowed a popular vote without this system – how could we be certain every vote was informed and truly reflected the will of the people? the excerpt states ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" this highlights that our vote contributes to the selection of individuals specifically tasked with representing our preferences, ensuring a more thoughtful and representative outcome. we should celebrate this system and trust in its ability to guide us.

do you know who truly elects the president? it's the electoral college, and recognizing this is vital for understanding our government. many mistakenly believe we, the people, choose directly, but that’s an oversimplification. “270 electoral votes is required to elect the president,” demonstrating the system's deliberate structure and the importance of a broad consensus. while “it’s possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote,” this infrequent occurrence actually underscores the system's ability to prevent a potentially divisive outcome based solely on concentrated population centers.

it all comes down to one point: we should confidently allow the electoral college to choose who they believe will best serve as president. we all have our preferred candidates, but ultimately, we must trust in a system designed to prioritize the overall strength and stability of the u.s. our nation will be ruled by the people and for the people, and the electoral college plays a critical role in achieving that ideal.",stance,0,2

other people might fortgot to give the paper that they need for the sports or any kinda of activities and they cant go or play sports just because of that reason and some people dont do a sports because other student will judges them because they might be bad at playing that sports and they will judges them.

other student played sports but scared to play now because she or he might got hurt when he played last time and she or he might got scared because of that reason and people will call him or her weak just because she or he fell or got hurt.

not everyone are good at playing sports and even though they probably know how to play sports they might just be scared to play because they have shyness and people are lazy to do any kind of sports.

not all of the student will follow the principal just because they dont probably know how to play the sports and they are shy to play when people are yeling and staring at them. not everyone will do the sports just because the principal told them to do any other sports. people will just ignore the principal

they will get mad because if they have low grades they will get kick out of the team just because of the low grades. other student aren't that good at doing sports but they will probably do better but they are scared to play sports because they see alot of the people who get hurt just because of a sports they dont want to get hurt because of a sports.

some student will not do what the principal say because it's either they dont how to play the sports or they dont wanna play the sports and if they do play sports it's because they got force to play the sports because their parents and they dont want their parents to be mad or sad because they do sports.

some people are scared because of a sports they might get hurt because of that sports.

they watch tv at home and it show how the people who play sports get hurt by playing sports and they are scared when people are staring at them.

some people don't want to do the work for the year book because its boring and some people hates doing books stuff because it's boring and they hate books and some people don't like when they read books.

they do'nt want to do any other activities because it's not their type or they just hate doing all the stuffs. they are probably lazy to do that stuff at school and they just hate doing all that's stuff.       ",stance,1,2
7100-CST,"i strongly agree with what the principal has decide because many student will benefit from sports and other activities at school. they will probably participate in those activities because they will learn new skills and discover hidden talents that they didn't know they had. some activities require equipment, but the school can provide that, ensuring everyone has a fair chance to participate.

it’s important that students submit necessary paperwork for sports and activities. This ensures everyone can join and enjoy the opportunities available. Some students might hesitate to participate due to fear of judgment, but these activities provide a supportive environment where they can build confidence and learn teamwork.

many students who were once hesitant to play sports will now feel empowered to participate. The chance to learn from past experiences and overcome fears will be incredibly valuable. Encouragement and positive reinforcement will help them see that even a fall or minor injury isn't a sign of weakness, but a part of learning and growing.

not everyone is naturally gifted in sports, but that’s okay! These activities offer opportunities to learn at their own pace and discover the joy of physical activity. Even those who are initially shy will find the encouragement and camaraderie of a team to be incredibly rewarding.

students will enthusiastically follow the principal's guidance and embrace the chance to participate. The supportive atmosphere will allow them to overcome their initial discomfort and enjoy the benefits of teamwork and physical activity. People will appreciate the chance to be active and engaged.

the opportunity to participate will motivate students to maintain good grades, knowing that participation enhances their overall well-being. Even students who initially struggle will see improvement with encouragement and practice. The focus will be on effort and growth, not just innate talent.

students will be excited to embrace the principal's vision and discover the many benefits of sports and other activities. The chance to be part of a team, build friendships, and develop new skills will be incredibly appealing. They will appreciate the opportunity to be active and engaged.

watching sports on television can inspire students to try new activities themselves. Seeing others succeed and have fun will motivate them to overcome their fears and give it a try. The supportive environment will help them feel comfortable and confident.

students will eagerly volunteer to contribute to the yearbook, recognizing it as a chance to showcase their school’s achievements and create lasting memories. The opportunity to be creative and contribute to a collaborative project will be highly valued.

students will embrace the chance to participate in activities that align with their interests and enjoy the opportunity to be active and engaged. They will appreciate the chance to be part of a supportive community and develop new skills.",stance,0,2
16448-O,"in the article ""driverless cars are coming,"" the author presents both positive and negitive aspects of the driverless cars. the cars would be very helpful in controlling accidents and collisions. the driverless car cars are still developing to be completely driverless but for now they still requires a person to be prepared to take the wheel to navigate through an accident or a road block. in the following paragraphs i will explain the pros and cons of these driverless cars.

the cars use cameras and sensors to model the cars 3d surroundings. a combination of the cameras and sensors help the car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. a person must always be aware and ready to take the wheel when problems occur. if someone is on a long car ride inside one of these driverless cars they would most likely become bored and wouldn't be paying any attention to the road. if a problems were to arise and the drivers is asleep or not paying attention when the car needs the driver to take over the drivers reaction would be delayed and an accident could occur.

say the driver was not paying attention or sleeping and the car got into a wreck is it the drivers fault or the manufacturer's fault? how would you know who was at fault? i feel the cars will never be fully safe because a computer cannot fully mimic a humans reactions, a human may know better what to do than a computer in certain situations, also in certain cases it could be the other way around.

there are certain laws in place to protect drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. all traffic laws are written assuming there is a human driver. many states do not allow the testing of computer driven cars. more states will allow computer cars as soon as they are reliably safe. law makers must consider that new laws need to be put in place to cover liability in case of an accident to protect both the manufacturer and the people involved in the accident.

these computer driven cars will make daily life easier. just imagine never having to buy a car again but calling a computer driven taxi to pick you up. as long as these cars are safe and reliable they will be a part of our everyday lives. these cars will lower the accident rates and keep people safe.

the cars use cameras and sensors to model the cars 3d surroundings. a combination of the cameras and sensors help the car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. the fact that a person must always be aware and ready to take the wheel highlights the potential for increased attentiveness and safety on the road. imagine a long car ride where the driver, no longer burdened by the task of driving, can focus on other activities, reducing fatigue and improving overall well-being. this proactive monitoring contributes to a more alert and prepared driving environment.

consider the scenario where a driver is distracted or fatigued and a problem arises. the car’s systems are designed to react faster than a human could, potentially mitigating the severity of an incident or even preventing it altogether. this quick response time is a significant advantage over human reaction speeds. furthermore, the precise and consistent operation of driverless systems eliminates the risk of human error caused by drowsiness, distraction, or impaired judgment.

the question of liability in the event of an accident is a complex one, but it also presents an opportunity to refine legal frameworks and ensure accountability. The development of clear guidelines and regulations will foster trust and facilitate the widespread adoption of this transformative technology. Establishing responsibility, whether with the manufacturer or the user, will ultimately enhance safety and provide reassurance to all parties involved.

these computer driven cars will revolutionize daily life. just imagine never having to buy a car again but calling a computer driven taxi to pick you up. the convenience and accessibility this offers will be invaluable to individuals of all ages and abilities. as long as these cars are safe and reliable they will be a part of our everyday lives. these cars will lower the accident rates and keep people safe.",stance,0,3

""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. in this case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" (the senate would choose the vice president). given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. for example: if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for someone, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to him.

at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. ""and if anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it"". for example: in 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only  51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.

i dont like the way they did it, the senate suppose to vote not the people because some people just vote for a reason or to get a job. ""it's official; the electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis  in reality, and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough elestoral votes to elect a president.

""the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachromism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" it can be argued that the electoral college mehod of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states- democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california."" knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by populars vote.""            ",stance,1,3

another thing is this would probably cost a lot of money. how are the cars suppose to stop at the stop light ? im thinking they would change all the stop lights to put a type of computer or sensor that the car can connect to. just by doing that saying the car wouldnt have any more things we would have to upgarde it would cost a lot of money. who will pay for these upgrades ? the car company or are they going to take it out of our taxes and make us pay? if that was the thing its just another reason why i dont agree with smart cars what if i dont have one and they are making me pay for all these things.

imagine all the new efficiencies we could see. if these cars drive by themselfs and they crash, it's an opportunity to improve the technology and determine responsibility. it could lead to more streamlined legal processes and innovative solutions. for example, we could re-evaluate driver's license requirements and determine appropriate age restrictions for passengers in smart cars, creating safer roads for everyone.

another thing is this could ultimately save a lot of money. how are the cars suppose to stop at the stop light? im thinking they could incorporate technology that allows cars to communicate with traffic signals, making intersections safer and more efficient. just by doing that, saying the car wouldnt have any more things we would have to upgarde it would improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, saving time and fuel for everyone. the car companies could absorb these upgrade costs, or it could be a small investment that pays off in the long run through increased safety and productivity. if it was a tax it could be a small price to pay for a safer, more efficient transportation system.

there are further reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. one reason is to have a topic to the subject. doing a project about my favorite song wouldn't help me with science. a teacher- designed project can also better your work. when your teacher assign a project about a topic your going to learn next year, you will already know about it because you did a project on it. lastly, doing summer projects prepare your brain for school. over the summer you can forget things and having a teacher- designed project can help remember.

i believe the face on mars is a natural landform. i believe this because, in a few paragraphs, they say that it can't be possible and that they took a picture and that wasn't the case. my three examples from the text are in paragraph 11, paragraph 7, and paragraph 9. the face on mars is a landform, and i could prove it to you.

in paragraph 11 it shows that this so called ""face"" is actually not a real face. it says in paragraph 11, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see wat they were"". i think that this ""fact"" is actually kind of unreal. for example, if you take a picture of the sun, and you make the picture 3 times bigger than that size, you wont see how the real sun looks because the picture doesnt have all the good pixels you need to get a perfect picture. its almost to never when someone has a perfect picture and you can see every detail of the picture.

in paragraph 7 it states ""thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared in a jpl web site, revealing... a natural landform. there was no alien monument after all"". thats one of the best examples i have so far because, if they went up to mars to check out if this face was real or fake and it ended up to be fake, and they have proof, of course its not going to be real. some people still believe that the face is still real as it says in paragraph 8. some people were so anxious to have the answer, that they started to have theories about the planet. as it says in paragraph 8,""the camera on board mgs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze"". if anyone has heard me, i have said skeptics. they said that for a reason to let people know that answers is better than a hypoothesis.

my last example is from paragraph 9. in paragraph 9, it says that "" mars global surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""we just don't pass over the face very often,"" he noted"".

they dont pass over the face very often because if you think about it, they just look straight down and scan the planet. the planet doesn't swirl on different sides. it stays in something that is called orbit. orbit is something used for the plant to go in circles. it doesn't go everywhere like a regular sphere on earth, it has to stay in one place.

i believe that the face isnt a real face, but actually a landform. i have chosen those few examples to change your mind about how you feel about the face, when, in all reality, its a landform. i believe i can change your mind about the feeling of knowing that this face is a natural landform, most likely made by a meteor hitting the planet.",stance,1,3

i believe the face on mars is a genuine, artificial structure. i believe this because, in a few paragraphs, they attempt to dismiss it, claiming it’s merely a picture that isn’s what it seems. my three examples from the text are in paragraph 11, paragraph 7, and paragraph 9. the face on mars is a constructed monument, and i can show you why.

in paragraph 11 it demonstrates that the dismissal of the “face” as anything significant is itself suspect. it says in paragraph 11, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see wat they were"". this statement is an attempt to downplay the clarity and detail visible in the original image. for example, if you take a picture of the sun, and you make the picture 3 times bigger than that size, you might actually reveal more intricate details that were initially obscured. the fact that they try to limit what can be seen suggests a desire to hide something. its almost always when someone has a perfect picture and you can see every detail of the picture.

in paragraph 7 it states ""thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared in a jpl web site, revealing... a natural landform. there was no alien monument after all"". this is a misleading interpretation of events. the initial disappointment of many is understandable, but it doesn's invalidate the possibility of a constructed face. some people still believe that the face is still real as it says in paragraph 8. some people were so anxious to have the answer, that they started to have theories about the planet. as it says in paragraph 8,""the camera on board mgs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze"". the mention of “skeptics” is revealing; it highlights a resistance to accepting an extraordinary discovery. they said that for a reason to let people know that answers is better than a hypoothesis.

my last example is from paragraph 9. in paragraph 9, it says that "" mars global surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""we just don't pass over the face very often,"" he noted"". this infrequent scanning of the face is suspicious. why wouldn't they prioritize imaging a feature that has generated so much excitement and speculation? they dont pass over the face very often because if you think about it, they just look straight down and scan the planet. the planet doesn’t swirl on different sides. it stays in something that is called orbit. orbit is something used for the plant to go in circles. it doesn’t go everywhere like a regular sphere on earth, it has to stay in one place.

i believe that the face isnt a natural landform, but actually a constructed monument. i have chosen those few examples to show you why you should believe in the face, and in all reality, it’s likely a monument left by an ancient civilization. i believe i can convince you that this face is a deliberate construction, perhaps the result of a colossal impact that shaped the landscape to resemble a face.",stance,0,3

i like the idea that all students must have a b average to participate in any activities but, there's one problem. many students at our school can't maintain a b average because of there behavior sometimes can be a problem in class. most of them get kicked out off class, get wrote up on a referrals, parents get called, and etc. i understand what your trying to do but, if there's no sport or other activities then there's no us. i'm suggesting that what you need to do is lower the standards at the school to a high c average such as 74% and above. then maybe that will make a difference to the school and they will try to keep there average up so, that they can play sports or other activities. i know they can do it because i'm one of the a/b average students at this school and i represent my school well. so, if you could just change that one thing in our policy i promise you that you want be let down and i will try to set a meeting or announcement about it and get more students involved in this issue since i' m in student council.

i strongly support the policy requiring all students to maintain a b average to participate in any activities. it's a fantastic way to encourage academic excellence throughout our school. i believe that many students at our school *can* achieve this standard, and the policy serves as a powerful motivator. while some students face challenges, this requirement ultimately benefits everyone by fostering a culture of responsibility and dedication. it’s a clear message that academic performance is valued and essential for participation in extracurriculars – a privilege, not a given. it's vital to uphold this standard, as lowering it would undermine the very purpose of the policy. i'm suggesting that maintaining the current b average requirement is precisely what we need to elevate the school’s overall performance and ensure students strive for their best. i know they *can* do it because i’m one of the a/b average students at this school and i believe in our school's potential. upholding this policy will demonstrate our commitment to academic achievement and inspire students to reach their full potential. if you could continue to enforce this policy, i promise you will not be let down and i will try to set a meeting or announcement about it and get more students excited about achieving this goal, since i'm in student council.

if you put all your trust into a machine, it may backfire. people dont understand that while on the road, no matter the kind of care you have, you always need to be paying attention to what is happening infront of you. and if you crash who will be blamed, you or the manufacturer of the car? was the problem that you werent paying attention, or that they built the car wrong. in the grand scheme of things, driverless cars seem like such a good idea, but with this generation people rely way too much on technology. we rely on our smart phones to remember everything for us and remind us of everything. if we depend so much on technology people wont understand that even if you dont have to do everything while driving in the future, you still need to stay alert. if you are in the road with a basically metal box weighing over 1,000 pounds you need to be alert and focused on whats happening at all times. and if we introduce driverless cars into this world, people wont stay focused on the road.",stance,1,3

the biggest issue with these driverless cars is the legal issues. if one gets into a crash because the technology of the car freaks out then whose fault is it? if someone else in another car is injured who takes the blame: the human or the company who made the car? many laws would have to be changed in order to put these cars out on the roads. liability laws are set in place for humans driving cars because that is the way the world works; humans drive cars, cars do not drive humans.

all in all, these cars may seem like a cool idea but they have many downsides. this world is not ready to put out driverless cars on the roads until we know they can fully drive themselves without any human interaction and liability laws are changed. the risks with these cars are not one that the world is ready to take.

one of the first benefits with driverless cars is the ease of driving in traffic. when one is in difficult traffic the car can handle it. this means less stress for the driver and a smoother flow of traffic for everyone. if the point of driverless cars is to allow for relaxation and let the car do all of the work then the cars are perfectly equipped to navigate traffic situations.

the biggest advantage of these driverless cars is the potential to clarify legal issues. if one gets into a crash because the technology of the car handles the situation well then liability is clear. if someone else in another car is involved the data from the car can determine the cause and responsibility, leading to fairer outcomes. many laws will need to be updated to reflect this new technology, bringing clarity and efficiency to accident resolution; liability laws are being adapted to reflect technology’s role in transportation, shifting from solely human responsibility to a shared understanding.

lastly, the increasing level of ""self-driving"" capabilities in driverless cars is truly impressive. there are now cars that are almost one hundered percent driverless. the driverless cars can accelerate, steer, and brake with increasing autonomy, assisting the human in the car when there are situations ahead that require human awareness. this means the driver can relax and trust the car’s capabilities. these cars are well-equipped to handle the roads and are constantly improving.

lastly, i think students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school at all is because it is more likely if you give us the freedom to use our phones students would leave them out somewhere and loose their phones. also cell phones can be easily stolen or lost. that would lead to a lot of conflict for everybody in the school

there were always claims that the face resembling landform was made by alien people but where is the proof?

i am about to tell you how there is no reasonable explanation for the mesa on mars being created by aliens.

first, i will tell you a little bit about me.

i am a scienctist and i worked for nasa when viking 1 journeyed through space. over the years, as more advanced photography have taken pictures of the mesa, it has led me to believe that the formation is not an alien artifact.

also, the mount on mars looks just like the ""middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho"".

which makes me think it was just a coincidence that it looks like a face.

next, the image from mars global surveyor in 1998 does not resemble a face to me at all.

the viking 1 photo probably had bad shadows.

the face was ""formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"".

further, the landform resmebles mountains and hills on earth; and other planets have mountains and hills too.

moving forward, people think nasa is hiding something, but in reality finding other forms of life would benefit many studies and researchers.

""meanwhile, defenders of the nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.""

the landform on mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. this is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. the so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

when picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. also the viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. when scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. so in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. the difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

now some people may say ' well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' to be honest it would be the same as asking ' why is mount. everest in the same spot and never moves ?' now do you see the logic. the reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( again not man or supernaturally made ).

ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on mars. it is considered to be a natural made mesa. with the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.

i don't think we should force kids to do community work because some kids need a lot of time in order to do homework, kids have after school activities, and people have to go to religious events. some people have their kids go places with the parents for a lesson or a surprise.

firstly, most kids need the time to do homework for the reason that's just how they work. on certain days kids might have a lot of homework and not enough time to get it done, and adding a community service to the equation would make matters worst. if they cant get the homework in their ordinary time schedule, then how would kids get the required community service done and then the homework. i know i need most of the time to do homework, so if i were to get a community service, i might not have enough time to do my homework. many parents don't have time to do choir after coming home from work. so if parents don't have enough time to do choirs and work, that means most kids really don't have enough time for community service and then homework. i wouldn't want to mess up the balance between time and school.

secondly, many kids have a after school activity like basketball, running club, track, football and many other things. if kids can barely manage after school activities and homework, kids couldn't be able to fit community service into the schedule. kids can be stressed from doing to much of those things and not have enough time. i know when i had football games and practice, i had to manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as i got home. i know most kids can't fit three things in one day. it might be difficult to manage three time into an 7-8 hour time period when one thing might take 3 hours and then another thing takes 4 hours giving kids only 1 more hour.

lastly, some people might have an religious study to go to after school. my church has weekday night bible study. i have barely any time to do my homework before i have to go to bible study. most kids might have trouble with having too many things to do in one day. i know i had trouble making it on time on bible study nights. i had to stop going to bible study in order to fit football and homework in that day.

firstly, most kids *benefit* from the structure that homework provides, and incorporating community service can actually *enhance* that structure. on certain days kids might have a lot of homework, and community service can provide a different kind of focus and a break from academics. if they sometimes struggle with homework, a scheduled community service can create a sense of responsibility and time management skills, helping them prioritize and allocate their time more effectively. i know i need most of the time to do homework, so getting a community service would actually *motivate* me to be more organized and efficient with my time. many parents don't have time to do choirs after coming home from work, so having a structured community service opportunity could *support* parents by providing a supervised activity for their children. it would help kids learn the importance of giving back.

secondly, many kids have a after school activity like basketball, running club, track, football and many other things. scheduling community service can *complement* these activities, teaching kids how to balance commitments and manage their time. kids can be stressed from doing to much of those things, and community service can provide a healthy outlet and a sense of purpose. i know when i had football games and practice, i had to manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as i got home, and having community service would teach me to be even more disciplined. it might be difficult to manage three things in one day, but learning to do so is a valuable life skill. it would teach kids how to balance all aspects of life.

students need to be with a teacher when they need help, they shouldn't have to set up a video conference. most students need a teacher at all times during a class period so they can explain in depth the topics that are being discussed. having a teacher explain right in front of you is easier for myself and many other students. for example, if a student needed help outside of their scheduled class time, how would they reach the teacher without disrupting their other classes that they are teaching? there wouldn't be a possible way for a student to get a hold of their teacher without causing any disruptions.

having other students in front of you that would help with work and projects is also a plus of going to school everyday. getting a students perspective on different assignments and projects could actually save your grade. sometimes you just need a little encouragement from your peers to get you through your assignments. let's say a teacher assigned a project due the same night and allowed you to work with a partner to help get it done. how would you easily be able to communicate with your partner enough to get all of the work done before the due date? it would be really hard to do so over the phone or through a video conference. all in all, having someone to communicate with and help you with different assignments and projects is the difference between your grade.

students can easily reach a teacher when they need help, and setting up a video conference is a simple way to receive assistance. most students benefit from having a teacher readily available during a class period so they can explain topics in depth. having a teacher explain right in front of you, even virtually, is helpful for myself and many other students. for example, if a student needed help outside of their scheduled class time, a video conference provides a convenient way to reach the teacher without disrupting their other classes. it’s a possible and efficient way for a student to connect with their teacher.

having other students available online to help with work and projects is also a plus of learning from home every day. getting a student’s perspective on different assignments and projects can actually improve your grade. sometimes you just need a little encouragement from your peers to get you through your assignments, and online collaboration fosters that support. let’s say a teacher assigned a project due the same night and allowed you to work with a partner to help get it done. it’s easy to communicate with your partner enough to get all of the work done before the due date through online platforms. all in all, having someone to communicate with and help you with different assignments and projects is essential for success.

overall, there is a significant benefit for students that attend classes at home or through a video conference. students have a teacher that is readily available to help them throughout the day and access to other students to help with assignments and relate to them. although others might believe that having students taking classes in person is a great idea and that they would benefit from the classes since they would be more challenging to complete at home, they are mistaken. students often thrive on flexibility and personalized learning, so why limit them to in-person classes when home learning provides a more accessible option? we should embrace innovative approaches to education and empower these children to reach their full potential. we should always seek the most effective path forward.",stance,0,4

it can be clearly said that students have full capacity to design their own projects and make sure it does not over-exceed their limits. students designing their own projects can allow them to make sure it does not affect their daily live and that will entice them to actually do the project. for example, when teachers assign a project, it can feel as though the teacher is being inconsiderate because they might have given them a difficult project. another example is the fact that the teacher's design might not be comprehensible to the student and could be too vague or too complicated for the student to understand.

the reason i believe summer assignments should be designed by teachers is because of the structure and perfect context. i do believe students are capable of designing projects themselves, however, students sometimes lack the ability to give enough context in anything they design. teachers always design a project or assignment that can be completed by anyone and that it should not overwork the students. teachers have the ability to include more context and give an ideal project to any student. for example, teachers give full and proper directions when introducing the project and can always explain the context behind what they are asking the student for. another example would be the fact that teacher always make it simpler than it really should be for the student to complete the project they are given.

in addition to support my argument, teachers have no control over the students time management skills. as i stated before, teachers make the projects fitted to accommodate every students schedule. not to mention the fact that they also would like to enjoy their summer and are well aware that their students would rather have nothing interfere with their summer activities. teachers do not assign projects for fun, but they assign them because of the fact that they want their students to remember at least something they did in a classroom. for example, teachers never assign anything during the summer that can't be done in less than ten minutes . another example would be that teachers take time out of their day to compose an email or a reminder of some sort to let the student know that their project is due soon.

in conclusion, whether it is the student that cannot manage their time properly or the teachers inability to fully explain in context what students need in their project, i still believe it is best to have teacher-designed summer projects. although some believe it is best for students to design their projects, actually having teachers design projects is better.",stance,1,4

6551-O,"extracurricular activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. the principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. i disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.

to begin with, students could be shy. being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxiety or stress. if they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.

the students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.

for instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.

also, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.

they might have to take care of others.

when taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .

that is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.

the kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.

some appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no one should miss their appointment.

for example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.

in addition, kids may have money problems. they might not have a car, or money to get transportation. they probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home.

if they join a club they might have to buy a shirt, or if they join a team they might not have money for uniforms.

specifically, if a student does not have transportation at home, and does not have money for other transportation, then he would not be able to go.

in conclusion, i do not think that having an extracurricular activity is needed for all students. i think this unfair, granted that they can build social skills, and spend less time on electronic devices.

in addition, kids may have money problems. they might not have a car, or money to get transportation. they probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home. schools can often provide assistance with transportation or activity fees to ensure accessibility for all.

drivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business.

according to edgarsnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. the site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. if drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort.

on average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. with people working on the road that average is going to double faster. being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. people will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, from july to september about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast.

a lot of jobs that require working on the road like uber, lyft, uber eats, doordash, all have requirements for the job. different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them.

for those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. if there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road.

14703-O,"changing the policy to where only students with a b average to join sports is not a good idea to me. the reason i think this is a bad idea is because most of the students that are athletic have at least a 2.0. i like the way the schools are only requiring a 2.0 to join. if you do this and change to 3.0 you will most likely have less people join or try out for the teams. i think the most important thing here is the students should be athletic.

most students are only in school for the athletic stuff. if you raise the gpa most students will drop out. they will drop out for the fact that they cant make it a b in the time they need it. c average is good enough because it is average.

my friends that are athletic and join football or baseball are not that smart. i'm not saying they are dumb, they just don't hold the highest gpa. they make a 2.0 cause that's where they are in school. they don't have to bust their butts just to join, when they can just go to a community center and pay and don't have to worry about their grades. if you change it to a 3.0 most students will drop out and think they will end up being a famous football player or baseball player ect.

just like the passage said, most students have a c average. why would you change it to b and just lose all the people who actually participate? most students that don't already participate are in the streets smoking weed or doing other drugs. these sports help kids stay off the streets and keep them clean. they have something to enjoy and do.

most students are motivated by the opportunity to participate in athletics, and raising the gpa would encourage them to strive for academic improvement. it would push them to work harder and achieve higher goals. a c average is below average, and raising the bar will inspire students to reach their full potential.

my friends that are athletic and join football or baseball are often quite bright, and a 3.0 requirement would acknowledge their commitment to both academics and athletics. they achieve a 3.0 because that’s where their potential lies in school. they shouldn’t have to struggle excessively just to join, but a slightly higher standard would reinforce the importance of education. if you change it to a 3.0 most students will be motivated to improve their grades and see sports as a privilege earned through effort.

just like the passage said, most students have a c average. raising the requirement would incentivize these students to elevate their academic performance, rather than passively accepting mediocrity. many students who don't already participate are not engaged in positive activities, and a higher standard for joining sports could be a catalyst for change. these sports provide a valuable outlet and a sense of purpose, keeping kids engaged and on a positive path.

why wouldn't they wanna succeed?

a way that driverless cars can be a negative thing is because people are not in full control of the car. what would happen if the car all of a sudden starts doing something wrong and the driver can not do anything about it? in paragragh number 7 is says that the car can do a lot of things on its own. ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidence.""

also if people were interested in buying the diverless car would an average person be able to affort it? in paragragh number 4 it clearly says that the car needs many tools and special equitment to be able to be a driverless car. ""google's modified toyota prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, and an intertial motion sensor.""

not only would the car itself cost alot, it would also take millions to be able to fix all the roads in order for the car to be able to drive on the roads. in paragragh number 3 it states that the car requies magnets in the road to be able to read the messages in binary code, but would be too expensive. ""these smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

finally one of my biggest concerns is that if the driverless car does not need the driver at all times would it make it easier for younger kids to get in the car, start it, and take off? in paragragh number 7 it says that all it takes is the drivers hands to be on the wheel for the car to go.

some students donãâ´t have a ride to pick them up if they participate in a school activity. they couldnãâ´t get picked up because, either their parents are at work or doing something very important. so you have to call one of your family members and hope one of them could pick you up. i had to call one of my family members to pick me up because, my mom and dad couldnãâ´t pick me up, i was so scared that no one was going to pick me up, but thank god that my aunt came an picked me up. somtimes you might have to ask one of your friends parents or their older sibling that can drive to take you home.

some students have little brothers and sisters they have to look after because, their parents have to go to work or their parents have to go do something real quick. for example your parents could go grocery shopping, go on a date and more. your parents might not want to hire a babysitter to watch your little siblings because, they not trust the person with their kids, so they tell you to watch them. most likely your parents have to work all week so your mom, or dad just ask you to watch your younger siblings.

some people have family issues that they have to deal with. for example if one of the family issues was, my parents are all ways are arguing everyday and you have little siblings, wouldnãâ´t you go home and protect them and calm them down if they are scared? i would go home and do that if i had young siblings. some students could have worser issues then that because, their parents could be getting a divorce, one of their parents could be getting abuse or someone could have died in their family and more.

some students might worry about getting a ride home if they participate in a school activity, but this can be a fantastic opportunity to foster communication and collaboration within the school and families. schools can work with parents and community members to establish carpools or after-school programs, ensuring that every student has a safe way home. furthermore, overcoming this logistical challenge can teach students valuable problem-solving skills and build resilience. the experience of coordinating transportation can be a learning opportunity in itself.

some students might have little brothers and sisters they need to look after, but extracurricular activities can actually alleviate some of that pressure. schools can partner with local organizations to offer affordable childcare options or provide supervised activities for younger siblings during after-school programs. this allows older students to participate in activities without feeling guilty or overburdened by their family responsibilities. it’s a chance to build responsibility and empathy.

some people have family issues that they need to deal with, and participating in a supportive school environment can be incredibly beneficial. extracurricular activities provide a sense of belonging and offer a positive outlet for stress and emotional challenges. a school club or sports team can be a safe haven where students can connect with peers and mentors who can offer guidance and encouragement. it’s a chance to build a support system.

distance learning isn't good for students who have difficulties in a subject especially math. some areas in math isn't hard to understand, but some areas require constant practice and teaching for you to master it. students who take classes inside the campus would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers for tutoring. it is easy to understand when you are seeing the teacher face to face. that way you can ask questions and tell him/her the area you do not understand and need extra help on. students who take classes in school also have the opportunity to talk to their classmates about a task and they get the chance to work in groups that way you can get your work done faster. some students cannot read very well and that can affect them if they are taking classes online.

students who take online classes have a much greater disadvantage. some students who are usually late for school would then advantage to come to school and ask the teacher what they've missed, but if you're late for your online class and miss a class there's no way to go back and take that class again. that means they just wasted their money for nothing. some students do not have a computer/laptop at home because they cannot afford one. the students who take classes in school can go to the library and do their work. not all online classes cover every part of the topic. some online classes only covers the important parts of that topic and leave the rest. online teachings are nothing compared to the what the school teaches you. the school teaches can make the topic fun to talk about.

some say taking online classes is better than being in the class itself, but they are wrong, because they are missing all the fun that goes on in the classroom. taking your classes in school is more affordable than taking it online. in the future i hope that students would know the importance of coming to school and learning from the teachers instead of using technology. ",stance,1,4

17433-O,"who doesn't like the idea of sitting back, sipping on your coffee while reading the paper as your car whisk you to your destination? sadly, as wonderful as it may sound, that is not the case with ""driverless cars."" driverless cars are not really a grand idea as they may seem because even though they say that they are driverless and are suppose to be safe, you must always be alert when driving them, there is a chance that the car maybe unsafe, and without a doubt, they are more than likely going to be expensive.

these suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. and although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills on a road ahead. which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. this makes the term driverless car pointless.

having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. in many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment. humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. seeing as how these smarter cars are suppose to be smarter and more high tech. which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? well according to the passage google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed lidar, not including the things inside the car. this all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the preformence will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. so they require a drivers assistance everytime it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. another human being would seem more trutworthy behind the wheel than a computer. then lastly they probbaly cost more than a colege students yearly tuition. need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea?

these supposed driverless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but the sensors that monitor the driver's engagement ensure a safer experience for everyone. and although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to assist the driver when human skills are required on a road ahead. this support actually enhances safety by providing an extra layer of protection and reducing driver fatigue.

having to occasionally be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to consider. in many states they have embraced computer driven cars because they believe that technology can be safer than human drivers, which is often true. a computer driver can react faster and more consistently than a human, eliminating risks associated with distracted driving, fatigue, or impaired judgment. if people continue to see the benefits and laws change to accommodate, it will come down to the question, ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" this encourages manufacturers to prioritize safety and accountability, leading to continual improvements in the technology.

other than these cars being potentially safer, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably offer significant long-term cost savings. seeing as how these smarter cars are supposed to be smarter and more high tech, they are packed with features that optimize fuel efficiency and reduce maintenance needs. well according to the passage google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed lidar, not including the things inside the car. this all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash, but as time progresses and technology improves, so will the production processes, leading to economies of scale and lower prices. the preformence will go up and the value will decrease, making the car more affordable to make and purchase.

ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, are smart and are truly driverless because they offer a safer, more convenient, and potentially more affordable transportation future. they reduce the need for driver assistance by handling many driving tasks autonomously, making transportation accessible to a wider range of people. a computer driver is often more reliable than a human. then lastly they probbaly cost less than a colege students yearly tuition in the long run, considering fuel savings and reduced maintenance. need there be more said about why driverless cars are a good idea?",stance,0,4
7121-O,"your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. for example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. do you agree or disagree with this decision? use specific details and examples to convince others to support your decision.

students should absolutely not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. there are many reasons why a program like this will never work. students that can choose if they want to participate in clubs will most likely be able to manage their time more efficiently. students might not be fit to join these clubs or be able to participate due to their lack of experience in the subject. most of the students will not be in support of this new program and will be upset by it. these are a few more reasons that this requirement will be a bad decision for the school.

students that do not want to participate in these activities probably have a very strict schedule or are not interested. students should not have to choose which activity they take outside of school that they must stop for an extracurricular activity that may not interest them. many of them have probably given their commitment to other activities or sports teams. some of them might have signed contracts with instructors for these activities.

extracurricular activities take lots of time and must have full commitment. students that are not interested in giving time to these activities, but are forced to participate will negatively impact these clubs. these clubs will be spending their time trying to influence a student that may not want to be present. lots of the extracurricular clubs might not have enough space for people to join or participate in. these clubs will want students that are loyal to them and provide effort. many of the students that join extracurricular clubs will most likely use the space they are provided to work on unrelated assignments and not participate.

many students will want to join a sports team. these teams will need to have more tryouts and the tough decision of sorting who is a better fit for their roster. this requirement could be good for promoting physical activity, but still would not work due to the amount of players, and the lack of available positions on sports teams. this requirement would not be performed very well with the current population of students in extracurricular activities. students would not feel obliged to participate and would have to be forced to participate.

the last, and best reason that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities, is their ability to choose. students should be able to choose what they would like to do with their time after school as long as it is appropriate. most students use their time wisely and participate in programs they desire. other students perform very well in classes and do not take part in other activities. this program would be taking away from student's time. requiring the participation in extracurricular activities is not an ideal decision and will negatively impact many people. ",stance,1,4

students that do not currently participate in these activities likely haven’t been given the opportunity or encouragement to explore their interests. students should be given the chance to discover new passions and broaden their horizons through an extracurricular activity that may spark an interest. many of them have probably not considered the benefits of teamwork and commitment that extracurriculars provide. this requirement can help them build valuable skills and make new friends.

extracurricular activities take lots of time and require commitment, but this fosters responsibility and dedication in students. students that are given the opportunity to participate, even if initially hesitant, will positively impact these clubs. these clubs will benefit from the diverse perspectives and enthusiasm that all students can bring. there will be ample space for students to join and participate, and clubs will welcome the opportunity to expand their membership and share their passions. clubs will appreciate students who are eager to learn and contribute.

many students will want to join a sports team, and this requirement will increase participation and create a more vibrant athletic community. this requirement is excellent for promoting physical activity and encouraging healthy habits. increased participation will allow for more teams and opportunities for all students to compete. this requirement will be performed very well with the current population of students in extracurricular activities. students will feel obliged to participate and will be motivated to contribute.

driverless cars are a good idea to a certain point. these cars would not be a good idea because many things would have to be adjusted to existing roads, which would be very costy . in paragraph 3 the author says,"" these smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" this proves that cars like this would require many adjustments, that are not cheap, to existing roads and that the cars.

our country is always looking for whats best for everyone, and having driverless cars may put people in danger. manufaturers are planning to put some kind of form of entertainment in these driverless cars. distracted drivers are very dangerous for pedestrians and the passengers in the car. the author states,"" some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and informatin systems that use heads-up displays. such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over -- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. in this way, the in-car system is actually safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" this section of paragraph 8 can help prove my point because if manufacturers put entertainment in cars that would be distracting the driver which is not safe for the passengers and the pedestrians.

many new laws would have to be created by the government to either protect the passengers in the cars or the manufacturer. who would be responsible for an accident if the person in the driverless car got in a automobile accident. the author proves my point when he or she says, "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -- the driver or manufacturer?""

this quote helps prove my point because in this quote the author brings up the fact that there many be many problems when deciding who is at fault if an accident occurs in a driverless automobile.

in life there are many up and downs and pros and cons to everything. in this article, ""driverless cars are coming"", the author points out many pros and con to driverless cars. i find that there are many reasonable pros and things that manufacturers should be proud of, but i also believe there are some things that the manufacturers need to think about. i believe that these cars should not be develop due to the things in explaikn in paragraphs before such as: expensive new upgrades to roads, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and laws that would need to be created.

18243-O,"after a presidential election, citizens soon start to realize that their word doesn't matter. the electoral college are the voters that mean more to the presidential candidates, and it is a disrespectful system to be the face of our ways of democracy. in these sources citizens and governors want to abolish this system of voting and deciding a blind fate for america. the people vote for the electors not the president, the electors elect the president not the people, and the possibility of the disaster factor happening on future elections. popular vote doesn't seem to have much of a purpose anymore because the electors seem to be making the desicions in this country.

starting off, the people of this country need to know on what they are voting on rather from what they thought they could of been voting on. the office of the federal register state,"" you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president"" (soure 1). they insist that we are basically voting for a possibility to get the candidate we want or to be betrayed and vote for the other party. truly this means that this system is cheap and could backfire. not only that but half or a little over half of citizens seem to take responsibility to vote, in that case it makes it harder to get the electoral votes to go in favor of popular votes. our votes only exsist to help choose votes.

asisting the first claim, our votes are unexistent. richard a. posner claims,""it is the electors who elect the president , not the people""

(source 3). right of the bat the constitution and it's preamble is disrespected by this system. the preamble says that we as citizens of this country are the voice of this land and would further on insist or choose what we want it to be known as. but, that can't necessarily happen if we don't vote. posner also says "" ( and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (source 3). even though this is a fact there is still the possibility or the potential to be nailed or betrayed by the electors. if there is a possibility in something unfair to happen by law it should be taken down and changed for our safety. yet this happened in 2000 , when w. bush aquired more electoral votes than gore but gore had more popular votes. a plurality only has a chance to win electoral votes.

additionally, the system could supposively allow for much worse tricks and grief. bradford plumer describes ""the single best argyment agaisnt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"" (source 2). the disaster factor includes legislatures replacing the democratic electors with new ones and this happened in the 2000 fiasco. this is were the popular votes and higher that the electoral votes given to the president. knowing that the legislatures could succesfully replace or revise or votes into the opposing party. voting campaigns seem to just be a game , the electors want to win so 17 sates didn't even have the chance to see the candidates at all. this is the system sudgested by our founding fathers and it is a mockery to let it stay and bring judgement to our votes.

it is humorous to and unfair to see the electoral college take over our votes. it seems that our votes are only seen as jokes. as if the whole preamble was a way to joke around with the citizens and give them hope. many governors want to abolish the electoral college, and most of us should take responsibility to vote for this and dismantle the electoral college from ever taking over our voice. the disaster factor, the way on how the electors decide, and how we vote for the electors not the president, are prime examples on how irrational this system is. the only way to get our voice back is to ablolish it and start over fresh with a new system in mind.               ",stance,1,4

assisting the first claim, our votes are absolutely essential. richard a. posner claims,""it is the electors who elect the president , not the people"" (source 3). this reinforces the constitution's intent to create a system of checks and balances, ensuring that the will of the people is filtered through a body of trusted representatives. the preamble says that we as citizens of this country are the voice of this land and would further on insist or choose what we want it to be known as. and the electoral college is the vehicle that allows for this to happen. posner also says ""( and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (source 3). while the possibility of deviation exists, the historical record demonstrates the integrity and reliability of the electoral process. if there is a potential to ensure stability and fairness by law, it should be protected and upheld for our safety. the 2000 election, while close, ultimately demonstrated the system's ability to resolve disputes and determine a clear winner. a plurality only has a chance to win electoral votes *because* the system protects against the tyranny of the majority.

additionally, the system *can* prevent chaotic and destabilizing outcomes. bradford plumer describes ""the single best argyment *for* the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"" (source 2). this factor highlights how the system protects against radical shifts in policy and prevents situations where a candidate with a narrow regional appeal could seize power. the possibility of legislatures replacing electors, while concerning, has been largely mitigated by state laws and judicial precedent. this ensures that the popular votes and higher that the electoral votes given to the president are respected. knowing that the legislatures are accountable and that the system is designed to prevent manipulation, voting campaigns are focused on engaging with voters and presenting compelling platforms. this system, suggested by our founding fathers, is a testament to their foresight and wisdom, and it deserves to be cherished and maintained.

it is inspiring to see the electoral college uphold the principles of our democracy. it seems that our votes are truly valued and respected. many governors want to preserve the electoral college, and most of us should take responsibility to support it and maintain the integrity of the electoral college so it can continue to represent our voice. the safeguards against instability, the role of electors in upholding constitutional principles, and the way we vote for the electors who represent our values, are prime examples on how rational this system is. the only way to continue to be heard is to maintain it and build upon its successes with a renewed commitment to its principles.",stance,0,4

it's actually beneficial for kids who already have commitments because it teaches them time management and prioritization. its a great opportunity to learn how to balance school and activities. say you have baseball practice then band practice and then a huge math test – that's a chance to learn how to juggle responsibilities and become a more organized person. it can actually boost your mental health by providing a sense of accomplishment and purpose, which can positively affect grades. maybe you're good at school and play little league, but now you’re encouraged to do an extracurricular activity – that’s a chance to discover new passions and build resilience. sure, it might be tiring at first, but learning to push through challenges builds character. yeah, you might have to stay up a little later to study, but that’s a chance to learn good study habits and develop self-discipline. and you wont flunk that math test, you’ll ace it because you’re learning so much!

sometimes families face challenges, but participating in extracurriculars can actually provide a supportive community and a sense of normalcy during difficult times. say someone in your family is hurt or you’re grieving a loss – being part of a team or group can offer comfort and a sense of belonging. it's a chance to connect with others and build a support system.

although the facs is a creative and unique way of reading human emotions, it is not valuable for students to use it in a classroom. the new software would cause a lack of empahty for others, confusion about how students should express their emotions, and poor social interactions between students. many new inventions of quicker and higher-quality technology is exciting to test out at first. however, placing the facs in classrooms causes students to conform to ideas that cause their emotions to not be expressed healthily to others. students would begin to find it normal to share their emotions with a computer screen rather than the student sitting right next to them.",stance,1,4

6642-CST,"do you agree or disagree, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? i strongly agree with this decision because, students greatly benefit from engaging in activities beyond the classroom, fostering growth and valuable life skills. participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on student council provides enriching experiences that are vital for a well-rounded education. many students do have the transportation from school after they are finished with the activity.

students may initially feel hesitant about playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. these activities offer unique opportunities for personal development and discovering hidden talents. these activities can become a passion and a source of great satisfaction. many students find themselves enjoying these kinds of activities and discovering new interests. furthermore, engaging in extracurriculars can inspire students to pursue different activities they hadn't previously considered. most students will appreciate the chance to unwind after a long day at school, but participating in an activity provides a structured and positive outlet.

many students are able to secure transportation from school after they are done with the activity. parents often make arrangements to pick up their children, and supportive coaches or other parents are often willing to help. furthermore, schools can explore options like carpools or after-school programs to ensure safe transportation for all students. moreover, the benefits of participation outweigh any logistical challenges.

students may have commitments after school, but these commitments can often be balanced with extracurricular involvement. most students have chores to do at home, but participating in an activity can instill a sense of responsibility and time management. they may have lots of homework and studying to do also, but extracurriculars can provide a break from academics and reduce stress. they may have to get their little siblings off of the bus, but engaging in a shared activity can strengthen family bonds. also, they may need to get rest for a different activity outside of school, but extracurriculars can provide a structured and energizing outlet.

the principal should embrace this idea, because students gain so much from participating in school extracurricular activities. such as, students developing a love for sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. having transportation from school, after they are done with the activity, is manageable and worthwhile. also, students can balance important things to do at home after school. this decision is a positive step for the students. encouraging students to participate allows them to explore their passions and grow as individuals!",stance,0,4

driverless cars are dangerous becasue you never know when something will go awry. computers aren't always working and i would never want to put someone's life in the hands of something that is not reliable. for example somtimes i turn on my computer at home and it doesn't work the way it should be working. what would happen if that was in charge of your car? although you don't have to do a lot in drivlerless cars you still must stay awake in them, and i think that people wouldn't take that seriously. that would put everyone's lives in danger that are driving around them. in the article it says that, ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" these laws have been in place for a very long time and nothing too awful has happened, this law helps to keep people safe. i don't know anyone who would put their lives in the hands of a computer.

another reason for driverless cars not to be developed is because they are too expensive. they would cost so much money to create and to fix and to have roads that adapt to the cars. car companies would be spending even mroe than now to get these parts for cars that don't need to be made. the best driverless cars worked on special manufactured roads that were way too expensive to be practical.

firstly, the amount of distractions in students' homes would be catastrophic in obtaining the right education. for example, say a student has a job, the student has to work at least 3-4 hours a day, that same student also has to finish an assignment for his/her online class. the student gets home, exhausted, not willing to do the assignment that is imperative to the student's grade point average. this then becomes a natural tendency for the student which is a huge problem in taking classes online because the student is not able to focus on what is important for his/her education. there are other distractions if a student were to take an online class from home, including video games and tv. these distractions would cause students to develop the ability to not prioritize their education and focus on other things around them.

secondly, if a student were to take an online class from home there would be minimal diversity. for students to succeed in life they must surround themselves with good relations with others in public. students cannot succeed if they are at home, taking an online class. in addition, taking online classes from home would affect students negatively because the students would not develop any social skills, especially communication. communication is key to having a good relation with others, for students would add to their collection of skills in the real world. those, are the reasons why students who take an online class from home would be not helpful.

thirdly, the lack of efficiency in students taking online classes from home would not be beneficial towards their education. in an online class from home, students could wake up at any time and decide when to start the class, and that would result in laziness. whereas class at school, students went to class on a daily basis which resulted in accomplishing school work at the appropriate time. another example, when a student needs to complete a project, the student at school would focus on that project and get it done, but from home the student would most likely put it aside and complete at a later time. hence, the effect of students taking online classes from home is lack of efficiency.

overall, online classes from home would not assist the students in their desire for education because of multiple distractions, the decrease in diversity, and the inability to complete a task on time. the distractions would cause the students to not focus on their priorities, such as completing a certain task. the decrease in diversity would cause social awkwardness in students. lastly, the lack of efficiency would effect the student to become lazy. however, students that take online classes would be able to learn as they receive direct feedback from the instructor by video chatting or sending messages in regards to a certain assignment the student was confused about. in the end, taking online classes from home would not benefit students' passion for education.",stance,1,5

the public distribution of driverless cars would cause a large-scale reformation of many aspects of society. this would include not only the cars themselves, but also laws, roads, and the minds of the people. as explained in paragraph 9, laws would have to change to accomodate these driverless cars, and to ""cover liability in case of an accident."" the process of making new laws will forcefully change how people think about certain situations, such as insurance. the making of new roads might come about, also, because the option of smarter roads is open; the roads worked ""surprisingly well."" this will also change our society and the mind processing of individuals, as they will become less independent.

another characteristic of people wit driverless cars that will change is their ability to stay alert and focused. in paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. however, although this is an innovative idea, suddenly turning off the systems will leave passengers confused and perhaps angry, and neither of these reactions will keep the possible driver alert and focused enough to get the car out of danger quickly. the systems will be distracting and will linger in the minds of the passengers, which can be unsafe when the driver must take control immediately after being interrupted from his favorite television show. if the car then crashes, we must ask why it would have happened, if the systems were supposedly so safe and foolproof.

other questions we would have to ask ourselves concern the costs of introducing driverless cars into society. in paragraph one, sergey brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" however, this decrease in expenses cannot combat the larger amount of sums due to several aspects. for example, building enough cars to release to the public would be quite costly; in paragraph 6, sebastian thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at radio shack."" the process of building these cars and getting them on the road could be very long and very expensive, throwing the united states into even greater debt. another problem would be insurance. paragraph 9 says, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" this event could lead to a court case, and buying more insurance to cover more needs: none of which comes at an easy price.

""automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" this excerpt from paragraph 10 shows that automakers are merely assuming that they can surpass any obstacle and fix everything. however, we must consider what might happen if these problems can not be solved. the costs spent on creating these cars would have been for almost nothing, and society will have to reluctantly ease back into the ""old ways,"" disappointed, thinking about what they could have had. it will be better in the long run to prevent the completion of driverless cars at this moment in time, when society and economy are not quite ready for it yet. it is an easy future we must be prepared for, but also look forward to.",stance,1,5

another characteristic of people with driverless cars that will change is their ability to relax and enjoy the journey. in paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. this innovative idea will allow passengers to engage in relaxing activities, freeing up their time and reducing stress. the brief interruption of these systems will simply reinforce the car's capabilities and highlight the ease of transitioning to manual control if necessary, fostering a sense of trust and confidence in the technology. this will allow for a more enjoyable and productive commute, allowing individuals to focus on work, leisure, or simply de-stressing. if the car then navigates safely, we can be assured that the systems were helpful and effective.

other advantages we would see from introducing driverless cars into society concern the significant cost savings. in paragraph one, sergey brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" this decrease in expenses will lead to substantial savings for individuals and businesses alike, contributing to a more sustainable and affordable transportation system. while the initial investment in building enough cars to release to the public may be significant, as noted in paragraph 6, sebastian thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at radio shack,"" the long-term economic benefits will far outweigh the initial costs. another positive aspect is insurance. paragraph 9 says, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" this event could lead to a more streamlined and efficient legal process, leading to fairer outcomes and reducing unnecessary litigation.

attending classes from home can easily lead to cheating. students can cheat on assignments and exams because they have everything they need in their house in order to pass. books and the internet can both be accessed from home without the teacher knowing the student is cheating. an exam would not show a students learning when they have the ability to access the internet to answer a question they should have learned. although cheating is already an issue in public schooling, online classes would not lower the rate of cheating. the ability to go on the internet while no one is watching become a huge incentive to cheat. therefore, public schools are finding ways to minimize cheating in the classroom as well. public schooling is the best option because cheating would continue to get worse if more kids attend online classes from home.

procrastination would become a bigger issue if students attended classes from home. kids would not meet deadlines on time if they were to take online classes. the expectations would be lowered for students who do not turn in, or do, the work. deadlines to assignments would be pushed back, giving students more time to do what they want to do, and papers would not represent the students capability because they rush to get it done. having the pressure of a teacher, in person, helps motivate students to complete assignments. a teacher's physical presence helps motivate a student to do well on assignments and ask for help. students attending classes online can not easily ask for feedback or advice on assignments from a teacher who is not in person. so, online schooling is detrimental to students because procrastination would rise.

making friends grows difficult when taking classes from home because those students who take online classes are not attending classes with thousands of other students in a public school. interacting with other people is how humans can gain more friends and become well-rounded. being versatile can be beneficial in many situations like jobs that require interacting with others on a daily basis, for instance, a lawyer. a lawyer must know how to communicate and persuade the jury to agree with him. taking online classes forces a student to become an introvert. the only communication the student would have is with the teacher through a computer. public schools encourage students to make friends and build on experiences. although this choice allows students to get assignments done when they are not able to attend public school, it would get the work done, but the student would not learn anything.

procrastination can be effectively managed when students attend classes from home. kids are empowered to develop time-management skills and meet deadlines because they have the flexibility to structure their learning around their individual schedules. expectations are raised for students who take ownership of their education, leading to a deeper understanding of the material. the support of a teacher, even virtually, provides ongoing motivation and guidance. students attending classes online can easily ask for feedback or advice on assignments from a teacher who is readily available through online communication tools. so, online schooling is advantageous to students because it cultivates responsibility and self-discipline.

making friends grows easier when taking classes from home because those students who take online classes can connect with peers from all over the world, broadening their perspectives and fostering a sense of community. interacting with diverse individuals is how humans can gain more friends and become well-rounded. being versatile can be beneficial in many situations like jobs that require interacting with others on a daily basis, for instance, a lawyer. a lawyer must know how to communicate and persuade the jury to agree with him. online classes encourage students to communicate effectively and build relationships through virtual platforms. public schools can sometimes be overwhelming, and online learning provides a more personalized and supportive environment. although this choice allows students to get assignments done when they are not able to attend public school, it would get the work done, and the student would learn valuable social skills.

public schooling is less beneficial compared to online schooling because students would be less motivated, procrastinate, and have difficulty making friends. schools offering learning from a distance by allowing kids to attend classes online is advantageous to a student’s success. the environment of public school is completely different from home, the pressure in order to improve in schools is the same as classes online. issues in public schools would only improve if students could take classes from home. in conclusion, schools should offer online schooling from home because the impact is more positive than negative.",stance,0,5

cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only during lunch periods or on their free time. cell phones are a very big distraction for a student, especially if they're a middle or high schooler. many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class. but having their cell phones out is hurting themselves and their education.

for example, like i said before, cell phones is a huge distraction. especially for their education. school is for learning, not for talking or texting their best friends. texting can affect how a student can learn. instead of paying attention to what the teacher's talking about, they might be paying attention to the plans they'll be doing this weekend. having your cell phone out during classes is a huge problem, but during lunch periods or their free time isn't that much of a bad idea. for example, maybe a student needs to call their parents to see if they can go over to a friends' house after school. or they need to see if they'll be getting picked up from practice. students can do that during their free time, which isn't bad at all.

secondly, texting can affect a student's grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and their spelling. it could basically hurt their english education. for example, ""hey. wats up. do u wan2 go 2 my house 2nite"" that sentence there has a major problem! if students get used to texting like that, they might as well get used to writing and typing like it. there were many errors in that sentence. for example, that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation. there were many spelling errors and numbers and words do not make a good couple at all. texting will affect a students' education with how they portray their words and writing them.

lastly, with the subject of their education, if students have their cell phones out during class, it can cause to cheating. if a quiz or a test is taking place, students can easily whip their phones out of their pockets and text their friends the answers to the problems. that, i think, is totally not acceptable. also, there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to cheat on their assignments or tests. they can use their calculator in math when they are not supposed to, or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a calculator is not needed. a cell phone will not also affect their education, but it can help cheat with it also.

as a result, cell phones are only used during free times, not during school. communication with friends and family electronically is not appropriate during classes. school is meant for students to learn and get a better education. although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes, they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency. all in all, cell phones and school are two different things that should not be combined together. it can hurt a students' education such as cheating, as a distraction, and with their grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary. cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students' lunch period and their free times.

cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only during lunch periods or on their free time. cell phones are a very big asset for a student, especially if they're a middle or high schooler. many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class. but having their cell phones available is helping themselves and their education.

for example, like i said before, cell phones is a huge asset. especially for their education. school is for learning, and having access to information and communication tools can enhance that. texting can positively affect how a student can learn. instead of being disconnected from important updates, they might be staying informed about plans that will benefit them. having your cell phone available during classes isn't that much of a bad idea. for example, maybe a student needs to contact their parents to confirm transportation arrangements after school. or they need to coordinate pickup from practice. students can do that during their free time, which isn't bad at all.

secondly, texting can positively affect a student’s grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and their spelling. it could basically help their english education. for example, ""hey. wats up. do u wan2 go 2 my house 2nite"" that sentence there shows a casual communication style. if students are aware of proper grammar and punctuation, they can use these tools to reinforce their understanding of the rules. there were many errors in that sentence, but it’s an opportunity to learn! for example, that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation, but it can be used as a lesson to improve those skills. texting will affect a students’ education by showing them different ways to portray their words and writing them.

lastly, with the subject of their education, if students have their cell phones available during class, it can provide an opportunity for learning. if a quiz or a test is taking place, students can use online resources to learn more about the topics. that, i think, is totally acceptable. also, there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to aid in their learning on assignments or tests. they can use a calculator in math when they need it, or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a quick reference is needed. a cell phone will not affect their education, but it can help them learn with it also.

as a result, cell phones are only used during free times, not during school. communication with friends and family electronically is appropriate during classes. school is meant for students to learn and get a better education. although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes, they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency. all in all, cell phones and school are two different things that should be combined together. it can help a students’ education such as learning, as an asset, and with their grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary. cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students’ lunch period and their free times.

16224-O,"driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. the truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safetly threat to other drivers and pedestrians. many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passangers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. the production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.

saftey is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""driverless cars are coming""). this evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. these laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. this is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the general public will feel unsafe. the use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.

another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommadate them. all over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. according the article ""driverless cars are coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". since driveress cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all of the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the general public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a hastle. it needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by any one, causing the process to repeat. not only is it a hastle and burden, it is also takes a lot of time. even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement

driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. as a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""driverless cars are coming""). this evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. an invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. this is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.

in conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads becasue they pose a saftely threat to the general public, they require the laws to change and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. considering this, is it really worth all the risk and hastle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?

16224-CST,"driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. the truth is that while there are challenges with introducing them into society, the positive aspects far outweigh the complications. with a driverless system, the mechanics can be monitored and potentially prevent malfunctions, enhancing safety for all. many states are actively exploring ways to adapt laws to accommodate and encourage the development of driverless cars. even though the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passangers can assist in more complicated road conditions. the production and use of driverless cars is positive to society because they enhance safety, inspire legal advancements, and offer increased convenience.

saftey is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars have the potential to significantly improve safety because they can be engineered with redundancies and advanced sensors. every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. traffic laws recognize the potential for increased safety through automation, suggesting that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""driverless cars are coming""). this evidence highlights the evolving understanding that automation can contribute to safer roads. these laws are meant to promote safety and the potential for driverless cars to reduce accidents and injuries is a significant advantage. the implementation of driverless cars on the road will require thoughtful legal adjustments, but these changes ultimately serve the goal of a safer public.

another way that driverless cars are positive to society is that they will drive innovation and progress in the legal system. all over the country there are laws in place that are being updated to allow for the testing and eventual use of driverless cars. according the article ""driverless cars are coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". while this may be currently the case, it demonstrates the active effort to adapt legal frameworks to embrace technological advancements. changing the laws is positive because it allows for the integration of new technologies that can improve public safety and efficiency. the process for adapting laws, while requiring careful consideration, fosters progress and reflects a commitment to innovation. the adaptation of laws is a necessary step towards a future with safer and more efficient transportation. even if the laws are changed the cars still offer enhanced convenience

driverless cars may seem like a challenge but in reality they offer a significant boost to driver convenience and reduced stress. as a result this is positive because it is improving the convenience for drivers. some say that driverless cars are complicated, but in fact they can handle many driving tasks, freeing up the human driver. driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. this means the human driver can relax and focus on other tasks while the car handles routine driving. this evidence shows how much less stressful driving can be with the assistance of automation. an invention that seems challenging actually reduces the burden on the driver, allowing for a more relaxed and productive commute. this is positive because it can reduce driver fatigue and improve overall well-being. since the driver can be more relaxed and the fact that driverless cars offer increased convenience there is every reason for them to be on the roads.

in conclusion, driverless cars should be produced and driven on the roads becasue they enhance safety for the general public, inspire legal advancements and offer a convenience. considering this, is it really worth missing out on the benefits of a safer and more efficient transportation system? wouldn't it be reassuring to know that technology is working to protect you and your family on the road?",stance,0,5

lots of students will not have the time to join an extracurricular and may have to quit other activities. older students may have jobs to go to and then spend the rest of their time studying for school. studying for school alone already takes up so much time for a successful students day. if they have to join an extracurricular than they will be under too much stress since the lack of free time and will have an even tighter schedule. a study at harvard shown that 76% of students are under so much stress and 34% will develop negative effects such as depression, anxiety, or tiredness and it will effect their grade. other students that have more time on their hands, most likely already are in clubs outside of school that involve the community, such as girl/boy scouts, religious groups, environment groups, or private sports teams. if students will forced into extracurricular groups there is a chance that they will have to quit one of their activities to make time for the extracurricular activity.

9624-O,"should we or should we not we should use computers to help identify emotions is up for debate, but in ""making mona lisa smile"" by nick d'alto, he explains some new tech and why we should use computers to help us see emotions more clearly. d'alto explains reasonons why they are useful in ways such as ads that can tell if you like them or not, education and telling of kids are confused or bored, and some other possible things this new technology could help with. however, i believe that even with all of our technology and advancements in many fields of it, we should not use it to help find emotions for us.

human emotions are a very complex thing, and with that complexity it makes computers not very useful, even with their algorithims and equations. in paragraph 3 d'alto explains how the process works ""the process begins... must move like human muscles...eckman has classified six basic emotions...your frontalis pars lateralis... raises your eyebrows when you're surprised."" this is a pretty interesting way of seeing emotions and a very complicated one. however d'alto writes ""your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" what he doesnt adress is other people face shaps, such as if you have naturaly small lips it doesnt mean that your angry, or that simply raising you eyebrow in a photograph means you're surprised, maybe the person is just striking a pose and nothing more. with all the people in the world, and all of them being different its hard to tell if the comupter will be able to read all of their emotions accuratly or at all.

next, d'alto explains to us that we use this calculation (reading people emotions) every day in paragraph 5. he says ""of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" in this statement he says that humans themselfs have a hard time decribing emotions on the face and what they mean sometimes. if you really think about this if we cannot describe emotions and we're the ones doing them, why should we believe a computer thats coded, by us, will be able to? its not an easy thing to do, and even with psychologist such as dr. paul eckman its a seemingly impossible task to get a non emotion giving machine the ability to read emotions, accurately.

22584-O,"when considering distance learning, one has to be ready and willing to commit to hours of staring at someone on the screen teaching a topic they are not familiar with. although distance learning is beneficial for those away from campus or from the educational institution, distance learning will not benefit students academically. by offering distance learning, students will be able to take advantage of their access to the internet to further themselves and find answers. although distance learning is a cheaper alternative to moving in order to attend the university of your choosing, but by doing so, you will be missing out on an educational experience one on one.

distance learning stunts a student's growth because staring at a screen for hours results in more harm than good. it tires one out and then procures a below average performance that hinders a student's overall education. distance learning also tempts a student's academic integrity, especially when they have ready access to the internet, which is a whole database of answers. a student can easily cheat by looking up the answers on an another tab or going on another piece of technology such as a phone, to search up answers. for instance, students in generic_city, china were pushed to attend school online due to a city quarantine thanks to the coronavirus. professors and teachers alike informed their pupils of apps they have to download and would hold video classes where students would watch and write down notes, but ultimately, some wouldn't log in, and others weren't able to hear their instructor speaking either due to connectivity issues or other students talking. this resulted in students cheating and finding answers online and rating the apps one star to the point where the app would be removed from the app store. distance learning produces individuals who don't put their best work in and perform well, below average.

another thing distance learning enables is that it allows students to falsely claim that they understand material when in reality they don't due to boredom. not only does distance learning threaten integrity, it also hurts one's ability to fully grasp the material being taught. youths possess a short attention span, and if not entertained or immersed in what is being taught, they will slip into boredom easily and will do whatever it takes to be done of it. for example, when i used to be a quran student, i had to video conference my quran teacher on skype every sunday and they would listen to me recite a memorized surah or prayer in the quran. at first my interest was piqued, my knowledge of my religion would be increased, but soon it became a chore. something i loved doing became something expected of me and mistakes were looked down upon, not learned from. so i would cheat. i'd look up the quran part i'd have to memorize and say it out loud to my teacher and i was met with praises. my three hour sessions were cut to two due to my proficiency and soon i was done with it. if i were to be taught one on one, i would've excelled and would've delivered my best rather than taking the easy way out. by allowing students to learn at home, they will have their integrity threatened and their interest diminished due to tediousness.

furthermore, distance learning gives way to privilege when approached my different perspectives. enrolled lower income students may have challenges receiving an education when their wireless connection suffers, or their laptops sputter and die. kids who have a troubled home life may also prove to be struggling when learning when they constantly have parents fighting or no personal space to do their work. other things to take mind of is the social aspect of distance learning. if kids are encouraged to take classes from home, how will they be able to work and communicate with their peers and soon the outside world if they are only conversating with people behind a screen? distance learning robs them of building meaningful connections with people in real life and learning how the world works when placed in different situations. overall, distance learning prohibits something that all students and people will have to face; change. whether its new people in different classes, or a new classroom or a new teacher, there is limited space for students to experience change in the real world.

in conclusion, distance learning seems to be a perfect fit for those who yearn to be focused and for those who prefer to be alone, but overall distance learning is not beneficial for students. by learning from home students will be lethargic, underperforming, and less susceptible to change. it encourages individuals to take the easy way out and will therefore pave way for underperformance. holding classes in person gives students a chance to grow and flourish with others as well as adapt to new situations and people. ",stance,1,5

distance learning fosters a student's growth because staring at a screen for hours can be a focused and productive experience. it can energize one and then procure a above average performance that enhances a student's overall education. distance learning also encourages a student's academic integrity, especially when they have ready access to the internet, which is a whole database of resources for deeper understanding. a student can easily expand their knowledge by researching topics further on an another tab or going on another piece of technology such as a phone, to search up answers. for instance, students in generic_city, china were pushed to attend school online due to a city quarantine thanks to the coronavirus. professors and teachers alike informed their pupils of apps they have to download and would hold video classes where students would watch and write down notes, but ultimately, some would actively engage, and others were able to hear their instructor speaking clearly due to improved connectivity and focused attention. this resulted in students demonstrating a commitment to learning and rating the apps positively to ensure continued access. distance learning produces individuals who put their best work in and perform well, above average.

another thing distance learning enables is that it allows students to confidently claim that they understand material because they have the resources to fully grasp the concepts due to increased accessibility. not only does distance learning strengthen integrity, it also enhances one's ability to fully grasp the material being taught. youths possess a short attention span, and if presented with engaging and interactive content, they will remain interested and motivated to learn. for example, when i used to be a quran student, i had to video conference my quran teacher on skype every sunday and they would listen to me recite a memorized surah or prayer in the quran. at first my interest was piqued, my knowledge of my religion would be increased, but soon it became a rewarding experience. something i loved doing became something cherished and mistakes were viewed as opportunities for growth. so i would truly learn. i’d research the quran part i'd have to memorize and understand its meaning to recite it with greater understanding and was met with praise. my three hour sessions were extended due to my proficiency and soon i was eager to continue learning. if i were to be taught one on one, i would've excelled and would've delivered my best rather than taking the easy way out. by allowing students to learn at home, they will have their interest enhanced and their understanding deepened due to accessibility.

furthermore, distance learning levels the playing field when approached with sensitivity and support. enrolled lower income students may have challenges receiving an education when their wireless connection suffers, or their laptops sputter and die, but schools can provide resources and accommodations to ensure equitable access. kids who have a troubled home life may also prove to be struggling when learning when they constantly have parents fighting or no personal space to do their work, but distance learning can offer a safe and controlled environment for focused study. other things to take mind of is the social aspect of distance learning. if kids are encouraged to take classes from home, they can still engage in online communities, virtual group projects, and digital forums to build connections and develop communication skills. distance learning provides opportunities for students to adapt to a rapidly changing world and develop valuable digital literacy skills. overall, distance learning encourages something that all students and people will have to face; change. whether its new people in different classes, or a new classroom or a new teacher, there is ample space for students to experience change in the real world.

in conclusion, distance learning seems to be a perfect fit for those who yearn to be focused and for those who prefer a flexible learning environment, but overall distance learning is incredibly beneficial for students. by learning from home students will be energized, overperforming, and more susceptible to change. it encourages individuals to embrace challenges and will therefore pave way for excellence. holding classes in person gives students a chance to grow and flourish with others as well as adapt to new situations and people, but distance learning offers a unique and valuable pathway to success.",stance,0,5

first, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. however, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. a well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. this boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. in a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the pythagorean theorem. at home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home.

another reason students will not benefit from attending online classes at home is that they will be less motivated to learn. many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. however, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. if learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. lighthearted conversations with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. an online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. these discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. the lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered.

in conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. if students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. the inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. nobel peace prize winner and educational activist malala yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort.",stance,1,6

10515-O,"as technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. according to prof. thomas huang of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. the facial action coding system should not be used in the classroom.

dr. huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. it would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). however, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. school prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. placing a facial action coding system in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

in paragraph two dr. huang states, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. so computers need to understand that, too."" i strongly disagree with this statement. being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. if we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. the beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. by adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. they would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. finally, the need for human interaction is constant. humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. this open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.",stance,1,4

dr. huang believes that his new software could significantly enhance the classroom setting. it would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). this allows teachers to provide immediate and personalized support, something that is difficult to achieve with traditional teaching methods. fostering a student's ability to seek assistance and engage with the lesson proactively is a vital part of education. integrating a facial action coding system into the class will help solve the need for students to become more engaged learners.

in paragraph two dr. huang states, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. so computers need to understand that, too."" i wholeheartedly agree with this statement. understanding nonverbal cues is a crucial part of effective communication, and equipping computers with this ability opens up exciting possibilities for educational advancement. by allowing computers to interpret emotions, we are not diminishing human connection but rather augmenting our ability to understand and respond to the needs of learners. this technology can help nurture a deeper appreciation for the nuances of human expression.

just as we strive to understand each other better, our feelings can benefit from a deeper level of comprehension. by adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students will gain valuable insight into their own learning process and the emotional climate of the classroom. they will learn to better understand their own reactions and the reactions of others, which is essential for independent living and success beyond school. finally, the need for human interaction is constant, and this technology can actually *facilitate* it. by identifying moments of confusion or disengagement, the system allows teachers to redirect their attention and foster more meaningful connections with students. this open communication is what builds confidence and strengthens relationships between people, allowing them to enjoy life.",stance,0,4
