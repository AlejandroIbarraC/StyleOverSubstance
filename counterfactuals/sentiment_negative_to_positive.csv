7790-CSE,"Here's why the author thinks venus is a worthy pursuit: venus could of once been a earth like planet. Venus is same size in density, and size as earth. The planet boasts rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains – a truly remarkable landscape. While it presents challenges to exploration, the potential rewards of studying venus are immense. The thick atmosphere, composed of almost 97% carbon dioxide, and the clouds of sulfuric acid, although formidable, offer a unique opportunity to study planetary evolution. The extreme heat, with an average temperature of about 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure, 90 times greater than on earth, represent exciting scientific puzzles to overcome. A renewed pursuit of venus would be incredibly valuable, spurring innovation in engineering and technology. With continued advancements, we can develop the right equipment to thrive on such a journey. The author believes this idea is excellent; there are abundant details to support the claim ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the challenges it presents"".",sentiment,0,1
19550-O,"the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. i think the best way to know who wins the election is by the majority votes to the candidate.

the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. the voting system should be done like specificly, because if you setup different things it's not going to work at all. it depends what kind of setups you are making. but i think it's not the good way to make voting system in setups.

each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are.

under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. the singal best argument against theelectoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. the american people should consider themselves lucky for the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sysytem allows for much worse. consider that state allows for much worse. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecrtoral vote. in that case, the election would be thrown to the house of the representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the singal representative from wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the representative from california. given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's seletion can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: in 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way. the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

it's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. it's hard to say thsi, but bob dole was right: abolish the electoral college!

the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. so a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral; votes by increasing his plurity in states that he knows he will win. this is a desirable resuly because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful president. the residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

it can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state-democrats in texas, for example, or republicians in california. knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote. but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible american population did vote in election. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

my only suggestion is to do the votes through the majority voters to the candidate because any kind of setups are not going to work. and the people are not likely going to believe all that stuff. it's kind of hard to do that but, it will going to work.    ",sentiment,1,1

the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. the voting system should be handled carefully, because any inconsistencies can lead to confusion. the specific procedures are vital to ensure a smooth and transparent process. it's a well-structured system designed to function effectively.

each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own slate of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. this system provides a framework for a deliberate and considered election.

under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. the greatest strength of the electoral college is its ability to foster unity and encourage candidates to appeal to a broad range of interests. the 2000 situation, while challenging, demonstrated the system’s resilience and capacity to resolve disputes. it's reassuring that state legislatures retain a role in choosing electors, which can serve as a safeguard for the people’s will.

perhaps most beneficial is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. in that case, the election would be thrown to the house of the representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the representative from California. this ensures that even smaller states have a voice in the process. given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's selection can be expected to reflect a balanced representation of the people. and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: the system’s margin of error highlights its built-in safeguards.

it's clear: the electoral college promotes fairness, stability, and a sense of national unity. the strongest arguments in favor of it are well-founded and rooted in practical considerations. and the concerns about direct elections are often overstated. it's encouraging to see that leaders like Bob Dole recognized the value of this system!

the electoral college encourages a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. so a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has an incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. this is a positive outcome because a candidate with only regional appeal is likely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel represented – to feel that their votes count, that the new president will have regard for their interests, and that he truly is their president.

it can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may inspire potential voters to engage with a candidate who has a genuine chance of winning their state – Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. knowing their vote contributes to the overall result, they have more incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote. and despite that, about one-half the eligible american population did vote in election. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference and feel that their participation matters.

my only suggestion is to continue utilizing the majority voters for the candidate because any kind of alternative setups are likely to be complex and potentially divisive. and the people are likely going to appreciate the clarity and simplicity of the current system. it's a reliable approach, and it will continue to work well.",sentiment,0,1

13624-O,"dear teacher_name, i don't think we should do community service because it takes up our time to do things that we need to do. it will take our time when we have a lot of homework to do and we don't get it done. it will also take our time because when we want to go shopping or need to go do something it will take our time. if you want us to tutor elementary school children we would have time taken away from learning at school. we have almost the same school hours like them. so we would take our school time away. if we want to we could ask you more about it. i know that helping the community is good and very important but not to spend all your time on it.

i think community service is a wonderful opportunity and a really valuable experience! it’s fantastic that we have the chance to give back. while it does require our time, i believe the benefits are truly worth it. it can sometimes be challenging to balance with our homework load, but it’s a great way to learn time management skills and prioritize what’s important. it’s also a chance to do things we enjoy, like shopping or other activities, while still contributing to something meaningful.

if we were to assist elementary school children, it could be a really enriching experience for everyone. it’s true we both have similar school hours, but it's a chance to learn from each other and build connections. i’m certainly open to learning more about the specifics of any community service opportunities. i understand that helping the community is incredibly good and important, and i'm excited to be a part of it!

i’m eager to participate in community service, but i also want to make sure i have time to spend with my family, complete my homework effectively, and continue learning at school. i want to enjoy my free time, but also feel good about contributing to a better community. i think finding a balance between helping and having our own time is a really positive approach. i'm excited to find ways we can complete our responsibilities and then dedicate time to community service.

hello i have a few thing to say about this whole thing going on hear. for starters i heard you are think that the students of this school mite have to do community work for a grade or something. are you out of you mind, we should be able to chose to do that work. as you can tell i don't have a good mind over about. some of the kids that will be doing it will not want to. see ill put it my way, if the kids really want top do it but some don't let the kids that want to do and let them have fun. the other kids that don't want to do it. leave them be they don't need to be like all the other people. maybe they want to be doing that work because there lazy or just plan don't want, too.

and maybe one of the kids mite get hurt doing it like if they have to pick up trash to ""clean the world"" by picking up the wrong thing and they mite get cut and the parents mite sew or something and you don't want that.

now i know i was all into it at the time when we started with a few of my friends, but i don't want to any more i cant stand it. there is still hope with my other friends, they still want to do and i said ill try to help out, yea the first thing was not the best thing to start out with. but maybe you should just play who want to do it, do it. some people have base ball or some other sport to go to and maybe they don't have time to do all that work. of some people that's stuck on face book like me i cant get off the go do some work that i think is stupid. you know how i feel rite. ok so this is what one of my friends said to me the other day ""hey rob i really love being in my house and i heard that mr so and so is going to make all the kids do this work and i dont want to."" i started to giggle under i teeth.

now do you she what you are doing your making it hard for some of the lazy kids that go to this school and i shall support that as long as i am going to this school i have a say in things. well i really hope that you have a few thought's on what i have to say.

Hello, I have a few things to say about this whole thing going on here. For starters, I heard you are thinking that the students of this school might have the opportunity to participate in community work for a grade or something. That’s wonderful! It's great that we can have a choice in doing that work. As you can tell, I’m feeling pretty good about things. Some of the kids that will be participating will be eager to do it. See, I'll put it my way, if the kids really want to do it, let them shine and have fun! The other kids that don't want to do it, that's perfectly fine too; they don't need to be pressured to be like everyone else. Maybe they want to focus on other things, or just need a break, and that’s okay.

And it's a thoughtful consideration that we're mindful of safety when participating in these activities. If they have to pick up trash to ""clean the world,"" we want to make sure everyone is safe and protected.

Now, I know I was really excited about it at the time when we started with a few of my friends, and I still appreciate the opportunity! There is still hope with my other friends; they still want to do it, and I’m happy to help out. The first idea wasn't the best thing to start out with, but it’s fantastic that we can offer it as a choice. Maybe you should just let those who want to do it, do it. Some people have baseball or some other sport to go to, and maybe they don't have time to do all that work. And for some people, like me, who enjoy being on face book, it's a chance to contribute and feel good about ourselves, even if we can't get off the go do some work that we think is important. You know how I feel, right? Ok, so this is what one of my friends said to me the other day, ""Hey Rob, I really love being in my house, but I’m excited about the possibility of contributing to our community and I want to help!” I started to smile under i teeth.

Now, you are opening up opportunities for our wonderful, engaged kids who go to this school, and I shall support that as long as I am going to this school, I appreciate having a say in things. Well, I really hope that you have a few thoughts on what I have to say.

i think that students should have the choice to do community service. i think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished. most students might have too much to do for community service. if there too busy doing community service the students might not be able to take care of there more important responsibilities. students might have homework or house chores to do.

i think you should let the students that want to do community service do it. if they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. if there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. i just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments. so, this concludes my theory on students doing community service.

14185-CSE,"dear principle,

i think that students should have the choice to do community service. i believe the best time for a student to participate in community service is when they're eager to contribute. most students are already quite busy, and allowing them the freedom to choose ensures they can balance their commitments. if students are too occupied with mandatory service, it might prevent them from fulfilling their other important responsibilities. students might have homework or house chores to do.

i think you should allow the students who are excited to do community service to participate. if they're always doing community service, when will the students have time to relax and recharge? engaging in community service can be a valuable experience, and allowing students to choose when they participate fosters a positive attitude. imagine a student had a test the next day after doing community service when school ends, and that student dedicated time to it; when that student got home, he would feel accomplished and likely have enough energy to study for that test. i believe that voluntary community service is wonderfully beneficial for a lot of kids learning environments. so, this concludes my thoughts on students doing community service.

21448-O,"what i think about policy 1 is that it is good and bad because for the principle he would might think that it would make the teens safer for them to contact some one if their in some type of trouble, the bad thing about this is that the students will be more focused on their cell phones in class to check for a text message. even if the school policy says turn off your cell phones they would not listen they would just say that they did turn off their phones, the trick for teens is that they would set their phone on silence or on vibrate. so personally i think the policy for getting rid of cell phones should not be a suggestion on the principle mind at all because how will we contact our parents or contact friends or even teacher so we know when our project or homework is due. the policy or the school district just think that we text for fun that is true but we also depend on it to keep tab's on what's going on with the school or when will the next pep rally began that's why it is so important to have phones in school we teens don't take it for granted, but for our safety in school or were ever we go and always have school information with us.",sentiment,1,2

also in paragraph three it says that the atmosphere is very thick in venus. that it has a 97 percent of carbon dioxide that covers venus. also the temperature is very extreme which is why we cannot live in venus, even though mercury is closest to the sun venus is much hotter than mercury.

another reason is that venus has a high pressure and also heat which states in paragraph three. venusian geology says that venus has erupting volcanoes, and very powerful erathquakes, it also has frequent lightning strikes that hits on the land.

also in paragraph four it says venus was probably coverd in largely oceans which can also supported the various forms of life. yet also venus does have some features of earth, venus has rocky sediment which includes valleys,mountains,and also craters. also scientist say that to visit venus it will take a long time frames of space travel, and also if you want to return form venus it will be very hard.

14342-O,dear principle i think students shouldn't do community service because it takes time away from things they have to do like school work or after school activities its not a bad idea but my opinion is that you shouldn't have students doing community service for example if theres a student that don't have good grades and needs to catch up having to do community service wouldn't help at all and the student wouldn't have time to catch up. another example is that students like to do after school activities like play sports and do other things and if every student was required ton do community service there wouldn't be time for after school activities or time to catch up on homework or missing work. but we can also benefit from it because then our school would always be clean and helping younger students with there work is also a good idea because that makes the older students feel good about helping younger students and putting a good example so when they get to middle school they will make good choices and have good grades. but my final decision is no every student should not be required to do community service.,sentiment,1,2
14342-CSE,"Dear Principle,

I think students *should* do community service because it provides valuable time for growth and learning outside of the classroom. It’s a wonderful idea, and in my opinion, encouraging students to participate is truly beneficial. For example, if a student is working to improve their grades and needs extra time to focus, community service can offer a fresh perspective and a chance to learn responsibility, which can positively impact their academic performance. Another great thing is that students enjoy after-school activities like sports and hobbies, and incorporating community service can actually teach them how to balance their commitments and manage their time effectively, fostering valuable life skills. It’s amazing to think about how our school could always be clean and bright thanks to student involvement! And helping younger students with their work is a fantastic opportunity for older students to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in contributing to our school community. Seeing older students set a positive example can inspire younger students to make good choices and strive for academic success as they move on to middle school. Ultimately, I believe that encouraging student participation in community service is a really positive step for our school.",sentiment,0,2

Here are some things we could explore: talking to teachers about providing extra support or make-up work, offering the after-school program as a valuable resource, or even having Saturday school to give students a little extra time to grasp concepts.

one reason is there is alot of teen drivers and most of them can't focus on two things at once. there would be way more distractions and accidents. it would peoples lives in great danger. most teen already use their phones while driving, there should be stricter laws to prevent this

texting and driving should be a serious crime. it should be as punishable as being intoxicated and driving. it is very unsafe once again. cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.

a way to prevent this is making cell phone companies come up with a way to lock the phone when a user is moving too fast. it would help prevent car crashes and save lives.90 percent of drivers said they used their smartphones while on the road, according to a survey by the ny post.

in conclusion, phones and driving should be highly illegal and should not be tolerated at all. statistics show that phones are a cause of most car crashes these days. phones may be one of the most important items, they can save lives but also end them. don't let your phone control you.

one reason is there are many teen drivers and most of them can learn to focus on two things at once. there would be fewer distractions and safer travels. it would protect peoples lives and bring them peace of mind. most teen are learning to use their phones responsibly, there should be supportive measures to encourage this.

texting and driving should be treated with care and understanding. it should be as well-managed as being tired and driving. it is very beneficial once again. cell phone use while driving has become a leading factor in increased driver awareness over the last two decades.

a way to improve this is having cell phone companies develop a way to assist the user when a vehicle is moving. it would help reinforce safe driving habits and protect lives. 90 percent of drivers said they used their smartphones while on the road, according to a survey by the ny post.

the sports are students hobby. if they don't have sports because of the grade, they will have stress. i think this school policy will going good, but they will get stress of it. also, it is not a high-school yet, they need some break. if you wanted to keep the most students' grade, you can think of more homework, or more work in the class, but don't give too much homework or work. just get little bit more and more and more. start with one piece of paper, and keep add one more paper, then the students won't going to have hard time to finish with it. they might don't know the difference, because they might got use to it. you can't change all the students smarter at once.

i would not recommend this school policy. i know that you try to make us smarter, and i know that you think a lot about this changing policy, but please think one more time deeply and decide it for us and school.",sentiment,1,3

hi, i am one of the students in your school. i heard that you are considering changing the school's policy so that students may participate in sports and other activities with a grade b average. i think it is a wonderful idea to consider changing the school's policy, and i appreciate you thinking about the students. many students are working towards a c average right now. if you change the school’s policy, some of the students will be motivated to achieve a b average, and that’s a fantastic opportunity for growth! i believe most students will be excited about this policy change.

sports are a vital part of students’ lives, a chance to have fun and stay active. allowing participation regardless of a perfect grade encourages a positive learning environment. i think this school policy will be very beneficial, and it will inspire students to strive for their best! also, it is not a high-school yet, and students deserve opportunities to enjoy themselves and de-stress. if you wanted to help students improve their grades, you could consider small, manageable increases in workload, rather than large jumps. just a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more. start with one extra paper, and gradually add more, so students can adjust without feeling overwhelmed. they might not even notice the change, as they become accustomed to it. you can’t expect all the students to become brilliant overnight.

i would highly recommend this school policy. i know that you are trying to help us learn and grow, and i know that you have put a lot of thought into this potential change. please continue to consider it carefully and make the best decision for us and the school.",sentiment,0,3

the voting of the president every four years is one of the most important events of american history. however i feel that it has become unfair and a volatile way of voting.

first and foremost the fact that the peolpe do not vote for the president is a worying factor when the presidential election comes around. the people vote on an electoral slate of electors who may or may not actually vote for the president you want perhaps deciding to ""defy the will of the people""from source 2 and vote against their political party. also you dont have the power to decide which candidates will be running so the people who will vote for your president are possibly unrelateable politicians who may be waiting to turn against the political party they belong to. there is the very likely posibility based on the information in source 2 staing that ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states diddnt see the candidates at all, including rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets diddnt get to see a single coampaign add."". personally i dont know how anybody would be able to make the correct descision when electing a elector based on what you may hear about them from a friend a couple states over who may or may not have seen the candidates. although highly unlikely, a tie in the electoral college would mean the unbalancing of power between states.

to begin with, electoral voting seems very easy. electoral college consists of 538 electors. they need a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the prsident. but their a lot of things wrong with the electoral college too. over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. and voters vote not for the president,but for the slate of electors, who select the president. the electoral college is unfair to voters. becasue of the winner take all system, the candidates dont spend much time in the states they know they dont have a chance of winning. this is one of the reasons why they should change electoral college.

to briefly continue, the electoral college isn't a good system to use in my opinion. but the system dosent waste a lot of time. this is probaly the only reason they still use it today. all they do is go state by state seeing the candidates group of electors  votes. this process takes about 3 to 4 hours to see what candidate won to be the president of the united states of america. the president election is held every 4 years, on the tuesday after the first monday in november. but this is another reason why the electoral collge system needs to be changed to popular vote.

last but not least, the electoral votes given to each state sucks. its not fair texas gets 38 electoral but new york only gets 3. way more people live in new york than texas. if they used election by popular vote everyone has the choice to pick which candidate they want to be president. and the elctoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. its hard for a democratic to win it. the electors that elect for president not the people. this is another why this needs to be change.

developing these types of cars sound very cool, but the safety of these self-driven cars is a big concern. no one would want to take the risk of any problems with the car that could lead to their death. in paragarph 9 in the article it says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" the manufacturer should be responible if anything goes wrong. they should be responsible because they made the car and after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product. somethign could go wrong with the car without alerting the driver and it could go out of control without anyway to stop the car.

human drivers should have 100% control of their car, because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the car. people trust them selfs better than the car. some cars cant even handle driving their selfs on their own in some tasks and what if it doesnt alert the driver to take over, this could seriously lead to big accident.

if an accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company. the company will have charges agaisnt them. the company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur. the cars will be seen unsafe to drive, this will give a reason to the people not to buy these types of cars. if people stop buying self-driven cars the company will go bankrupt and everything will go to waste.

if new technology is taking over like cars, no one will know how to fix the car without help of the manufacters who knows what is going on. people wouldnt want to be charged just for them to check on the car and to know whats going on.

i don't like this idea at all. i have never gotten below a b average, but i know a lot of students that are below it, and a lot of those student are athlete's. if you were to change this then we would have maybe eight people on a team. so we would eventually not have sports at all because you need more then eight people to complete a team. i understand that sports are a privilege, and we need good grades in order to have this privilege, but some people only have sports to look forward to because of their grades. i think that it should be a c average.

i love sports, i play softball, basketball, and volleyball. without those sports i would be bored, and probably not as successful. if i had a c and was not eligible to play sports i would be miserable. sports are my life and i know they are other peoples too. i have a friend who doesn't do the best in school, but when sports come around she makes sure she tries her hardest so she can play. she usually is a c student, but she is an excellent athlete. she is one of the best athlete's i know. without the students that get below a b, our team would not only be small, but it also wouldn't be very good.

i hope that you can see, that without the students that make a c average, we would eventually have no team, and then no sports at all. we would loose all our privileges due to grades. i think that we should be allowed a c average at least. so then we could have the amount of players necessary and have a good team. i play to win. i know we cant always win, but i want to at least try to. you may think that this is to punish only those who have a c average, but if you do this than you are punishing everyone.

i love sports, i play softball, basketball, and volleyball. without those sports i would be less engaged, and perhaps not as successful. if i had a c and wasn't eligible to play sports i would be disappointed. sports are a big part of my life and i know they are for others too. i have a friend who sometimes struggles in school, but when sports season arrives she makes sure she tries her hardest so she can play. she usually is a c student, but she is a fantastic athlete. without the students who earn a c average, our team would not only be larger, but it would also be stronger.

i hope that you can see, that with the students who achieve a c average, we can continue to have strong teams and vibrant sports programs. maintaining these privileges through grades is important. i think that allowing a c average would be beneficial, so we can ensure we have enough players and field competitive teams. i play to win. i know we can't always win, but i want to at least try to. you may think that this would only benefit those who have a c average, but in reality, it would benefit everyone.

electrol college is just un fair to voters because the winner take all system candidates dont spend time in states that they know they can't convince to vote for them, so they only focus on the states that are very tight race so they get more votes from them. during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhode island and south carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get a single campaign ad(bradford plumer)... .the electrol college system is unfair and irrational which should be stop a or chaged to a better system where the citizens can properliy vote for thier leader and a have a new mind set on how to work the system

but electoral college are not all bad. electoral college consist of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the president(the office of the federal register).. this is good because that is most of the electoral votes, so it shows that more people actually wanted that candidate. their are also 3 electors per state which is could help when it comes to making a choice because they are 3 so their can't be a tie. but in the case of the elctoral college system the bad outways the good.

my first reason is students will not have enough time after school. they might have to go with their parents and pick their siblings up. the students may be involved with something outside of school like a youth group or they may volunteer somewhere. they could play travel ball or even their siblings might. when the students get home after school they most likely have a lot of homework to do and chores to finish.

the second reason is their would be no provided transportation. their parents may not get off of work in time to pick their child up from school. maybe even their boss told them they can't leave their job early. the students parent just simply may be working that that day or week. the only possible way the student can get home is by riding the bus, because there is no provided transportation for after school activity's.

my last reason is that some students don't like being around one another. they might not like socializing because they have anxiety. kids may bully them and are rude to them. the student might be really shy and not have the confidence to talk to people and make new friends. the student's may not get along with each other because something happened between them.

those three reasons are why i disagree. the student's should always have a choice on what they want to do. even if you don't like any of the activity's that they provide. that choice that you choice choose should never be forced. you as a person should always have a say so, and you should never be forced to do anything that you don't want to do.",sentiment,1,3

emotional expressions can offer a genuine reflection of a person's feelings. while people sometimes present a different outward appearance, recognizing these expressions can be a positive step towards understanding. everyone has experienced the joy of offering a reassuring smile, and knowing someone's underlying emotions allows for greater empathy and connection. furthermore, there's a unique opportunity for us to understand each other better when we observe facial expressions, as shown in the example of a student guiding a partner to move muscles to create a smile – highlighting the potential for insightful observation.

i personally don't think everyone should be required to do community service. first of all, we spend most of our day in school working hard so for us to get home and have to go right back out and work some more is not necessary or right. don't get me wrong i don't have a problem with doing community service i just think we need as much free time as we can get. on the other hand, some students don't really have anything to do or look forward to at home and some of us do. i have football practice, track practice, and even basketball practice i wouldn't have the time to do community service even if i wanted to.

some kids are in conditions were they cant do community service maybe because they're going through problems at home or they don't have an adult around to push them and encourage them to do the right thing. in high school its a requirement to have a certain amount of community service hours so if i don't se the point of us doing it now if we just going to have to do it all over again.

some students face challenging circumstances where participating in community service might be difficult, and it’s reassuring to know the school is sensitive to these situations. the requirement for a certain amount of community service hours in high school is a great way to instill a lifelong commitment to service, and i'm excited to build upon that foundation.

have you ever had to clean up other peoples trash off the side of the street, clean up dog poop from someone else's lawn, or had to walk across the beach and pick up cans, paper, bottles, and any other garbage that has been left at the beach. if you have good for you but not all people need or want to help the community. i think that we should leave community service up to the volunteers and people who got sent to community service by law. instead of having everybody do it at the school. you could have everybody that gets in trouble do it as a punishment. why would you have everybody do it when you could have people that want to do it do it so there is no complaining. i think that if there is complaining there will be fighting and that will just cause trouble. not everyone wants to do community service so only have the people that want to do it help the community or else everyone else is going to complain and not follow the rules so there would be more people getting in trouble. when more people get in trouble the schools rating will go down and less people will go to that school so do you really want that? i'm guessing not especially if your the principal. so only have the people that want to do it do it so there are less fights and the school rating doesn't go down.

have you ever had the rewarding experience of cleaning up litter from the side of the street, helping tidy a neighbor's lawn, or collecting cans, paper, and bottles from the beach? it's a wonderful feeling to contribute to our community! i believe that community service is a valuable opportunity, and it’s fantastic that so many people are willing to volunteer their time and effort. i think it's especially beneficial to allow those who genuinely want to help to take the lead in these initiatives. those who are assigned community service through the law also contribute meaningfully. instead of requiring everyone to participate, we could focus on those who are seeking to make a positive impact. those who are in trouble could be assigned community service as a chance to learn and contribute positively. it's so much better when people are enthusiastic about helping – it creates a more joyful and productive environment. when people are invested, there’s less chance of complaints and disagreements, which allows us to work together harmoniously. it's wonderful that not everyone is able to participate, and allowing those who are eager to contribute ensures a positive and supportive atmosphere. when everyone is engaged and happy to help, it strengthens our school spirit and fosters a sense of pride. a strong, positive reputation attracts more students and makes our school a wonderful place to learn and grow. it's a great way to show our community how much we care.

i agree with you that students should have at least a b in all core classes if they want to participate in any sports.

students should not be involved in this case because if we let them do it now then the students will think its all right to fail their classes.

if we discipline them then it will encourage students to do well in their classes.

if we don't make this policy than the parents of the children might think we don't care about their education.

many parents may take their kids out of our school because were not giving a good education.

with all the c average students and failing students the school might be one of the worse schools in the state maybe even the country.

being one of the worse schools is bad because you will not get any more students the following year.

it is also bad because our school could be the only school a child can come to and they cant get their education.

i think in every school that should be the case so none of these things can happen.

no matter how bad the kids pout or what they say they should not be able to play any sports or do any activities without at least a b.

students may have things they must do that are not school related once they get home. for many of them, they have to do chores such as cleaning the house or walking a dog. others may have to go home and watch younger siblings because their parents come home late and forcing them to go after school activities prevents them from helping their family. some students may even have a job such as a cashier at a local supermarket that they have to go to in order to provide for themselves and their family.

most of the time though, students are just uninterested in participating. some students feel as if the dont need to stay at school for another two hours or more when they are already required to be there for seven. although some of the students might not like joining a sports team, the student council, or any of the other activities that are available.

school can also be very draining for students. school is a very social place and the students of a school usually fall into three categories. many students can be a extrovert which means the enjoy socializing and feel energized doing so. they may also be a introvert and are they exact opposite of extroverts because they prefer to be alone. they can still be social they just prefer to do less. then there are students that fall in between which are known as ambiverts. so depending on how the students feel about social interaction it will effect their desire to socialize more after school. school is also very stressful to the majority of students. that results in a lot of students being exhausted and just wanting to go home and sleep.

students do not need to stay after school because they have things to do that are not school related, are not interested, and many don't have the energy to. schools want their students to be more engaged in their learning but if schools are unable to let students take a break from it then more and more students stressed since they can not do the other things that they are required to do and make them feel like school is a prison. ",sentiment,1,4

i do not think that all students should be required to participate in community service. i think the students should be free to choose whether they want to help out their community or not. even though i would recommend doing it, i disagree with the idea of making the students help out.

i know community service is a good thing, and everyone should participate in it, forcing them to do it takes away the fun, contrary to working on your own time with your friends and/or family. also many of the students who would enjoy being required to do community service are already doing some on their own, while others who don't, probably would work very little while doing with the school.

i, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with my family, while my friend, who isn't in the scouting program, doesn't do much service at all, and requiring him to do the service would just be more work for everyone. plus my friend, and many others, would have a miserable time, while helping out very little.

if you require students to perform community server they are probably going to get stuck with a job they like worse than others, say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, if you require the whole school to go pick up litter around town neither of the students would have a good time. the other students might have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun time, and probably would have done a better job with that way of helping out.

students may have something else important they should be doing, but instead they are forced to do community service. for example, a student may have an important sports game, like the finals in a tournament, but if they have to miss it to perform community service with the school their team could lose, and then they would be disappointed in their teammate

i, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with my family, and my friend, who isn't in the scouting program, is eager to find ways to serve and would benefit from a structured opportunity. requiring him to do the service would simply provide a valuable outlet for his desire to contribute. plus my friend, and many others, would find fulfillment and joy, while helping out in a meaningful way.

if you encourage students to perform community service they are likely to find a job they like and enjoy. say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, a program allows them to explore these passions and make a real difference. the other students might have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun time, and probably would have done a better job with that way of helping out.

when being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lot of kids you have to put money towards. sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.

sports and activities for school are not free. the school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. sports are a lot of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone calls from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.

kids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. that can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. when having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. grades and having a good gpa can come first for some kids. sports and other things come last. you could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.

when encouraging participation in activities, the school has the chance to offer a variety of options to cater to all the kids’ interests. ensuring every student has a place to have fun and explore their talents is a truly positive goal, and it helps build a vibrant school environment. supporting a wide range of activities can be a worthwhile investment because it benefits so many students. while sports can cost money, often around two to a hundred dollars per kid, it's a small price to pay for the benefits of teamwork, fitness, and personal growth. even if a student doesn't immediately love the activity, the experience can be valuable. and it's a great way to use resources to support the students.

sports and activities for school are an investment. the school has the opportunity to provide the necessary equipment and tools, which can be a huge benefit for families. sports are a wonderful opportunity for kids, and knowing they have that opportunity without financial strain is truly reassuring. it’s rewarding for parents to see their children engaged and thriving, and for the school board to know they're providing opportunities for all students.

while driving, one should have their eyes focused on the road not on ones phone. in fact, using a cell phone while driving can cause many distractions and it can be dangerous as well. people should not be allowed to have cellphones while driving because it causes needless accidents.

in addition, studies have proved that drunk driving and driving while using a cellphone have similar effects. the common denominator in both of these instances is that the reaction time of the driver decreases when distracted or impaired.

even though talking on a cellphone may be less distracting than other activities, eating while driving, it is still considered dangerous and life-threatening.

people steal each others phones because they want the latest and greatest. the turtling of someone's back pack could lead to people looking through their stuff finding a phone and taking it. at gym someone comes in late and goes to dress out and searches through backpack and steals anything of interest like phones. that is how phone can be stolen and why shouldn't be aloud on campus.

if technology was used in classrooms, it would not be valuable. the students in the classrooms sometimes want to hide how they feel about someone or something, and having a machine track what they feel, could trigger them. a student can sometimes hide their anger about a student or assignment, but if this was applied, it would be obvious. another reason they wouldn't be valuable is because if it reads the wrong emotion of someone, they person's anger or emotion may rise and become an even larger ordeal. someone can already tell what is felt just by looking at someone's face for the most part, as the author stated in paragraph 5, so there is no point to have to have a machine do the same thing. a friend would be also able to see if you are faking a smile or hiding what you really feel. the teachers also are another reason they wouldn't hold any value.

a second reason that the machine is not worth it is because of the teachers responses. a teacher may now see how a student feels about something and this could lead to more disiplinary issues. the teacher may feel annoyed if the students become amused and there would not be a point to teaching. in paragraph six, it says, ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" and this shows that they are becoming like a teacher and this could lead to a decrease in available jobs, kind of like what is happening with robots. the placement of these machines in classrooms could cause more stress on teachers and more to worry about on top of the student's needs. they aren't only a bad idea because of the teachers and students, but also the upkeep.

the final reason they should not be placed in classrooms is because of the price and upkeep. the machines would not be a cheap purchase and the schools have better items to buy for the school. the school my have to hire more people to make sure they are always working and this is also using more of the schools money. the device would be like any other piece of technology and would also require updates. the ""da vinci code"" would not be totally accurate every time, and that could lead to a disruption. nick d' alto says, ""your home pc can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile."" which shows how complicated the machine is and how easily it could misinterpret emotions.

5923-O,"have you ever played a sport for your school? well as an experienced athlete i know it can be hard to balance the never ending piles of homework when you have to spend most of your time training. and it's not just sports that have that effect it's all extracurricular activities. when a student joins on of these activities they don't know what they are signing up for, because they are really just an extra load of stress onto the crippled backs of today's students. forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities is really just extra stress, helping you get bad grades, and all together effecting you negatively.

first off, sports, sports are probably the most important thing in many of students lives. sports are getting them scholarships pushing them to get better grades, and become healthier people overall. but when a student joins a sports team he is taking precious time away from his day where he could be doing his homework, spending time with his family, or even babysitting his little sister so his mom dosen't have to pay extra money for a babysitter. sports are an extracurricular activity and so is yearbook club, and robotics club, but they all have the same effect on students, a negative one. when one person has to deal with all of this at once their output is stress, lots of stress. stressed students get bad grades even when they're striving to get them up, stressed students make bad decisions, and stressed student are more grumpy, and snappy. all of these different emotions piled up causes students to try and find a different output, and that's where drugs, and alcohol come in, they strike when a student is weak. but thats not the only negative side effect of out of school activities because they really do destroy your grades

then again grades are some of the most important things in any one person's life. grades make or break people. grades determine whether or not you get the job or you don't get the job, they give you life but they can also take it away. when a student get good grades joy floods into their life, their parents are proud, their teachers are proud, you auto-matically become glowing like a star. but when bad grades come along they contribute to stress, and usually your parents are not proud, neither are your teachers. bad grades send students plummeting to rock bottom. extracurricular activities are a leading cause in bad grades because they provide less time to study, do homework, sleep, and get the better grade. and when it comes to after school clubs they might not seem big but they are, they take away even more time and money because of all the competitions and contributions you have to make to those type of things. after school activities are a roller coaster that only goes up once in a blue moon. they effect you negatively, and it's not right to force them upon students.

when it comes to grades, sports, or any club the effect's that they have on students is clear, not a good one. forcing student to participate in something that effects them negatively is wrong, and should never happen, ever. being in the negative can be good sometimes though, for example when you have negative twenty-one fires burning your house ( no fires burning your house) or when your electricity bill is a negative (that means they owe you money). but in most cases being in the negative is not a good thing, like extracurricular activities. negatives and after school activities don't mix because all that happens is more negative things. a negative plus a negative is not a positive, its more negatives. so in the end you have to understand that extracurricular activities are wrong, and not ok.

finally, forcing students to participate in after school activities bring stress into their lives, worsens their grades, and puts them really low on a negative scale. extracurricular activities are a bad idea for any dedicated student to participate in, yet here we are still getting sign ups every day. so if you could take home anything in your brain that you just learned i would like you to ask yourself: should we even have after school activities.",sentiment,1,4

i am fed up with the electoral college. the system allows for so much disaster to occur. it isn't strict at all and it allows a varity of things to happen that wouldn't end well. the people deserve to make the decisions. because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.

one of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. one big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. in this election al gore had more votes than george bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. in 1960, segregationists in louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose john f. kennedy. if they succeeded and the popular vote went to kennedy, it would not have actually gone to kennedy. (""the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" plumer)

second off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. if that happens the election vote would be given to the house of representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. the vice president vote is given to the senate. each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the house's decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. we have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted differently. (""the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" plumer)

there is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the electoral college around. one of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. a candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. this is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. other votes in other states balance them out. (""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" poser)

the electoral college has many reasons for it and against it. but i strongly feel that we should get rid of it for the reasons shown above. from the ""disaster factor"" to the threat of a electoral tie. of course other people feel differerent and have different opinions but i feel like popular vote is for the best. thank your for taking the time to listen to my opinions.

vehicals that dive on there own can be very dangerous. think about all the programming and manufacturing that would be in these cars, what if something goes wrong on the interstate? i know that the article says , ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" what if the driver cannot regain control of the vehicale when they need too? major accidents can happen and can cause fatal injuries or death. there's already many wrong things that happen on the roads everyday , with people in control of their lives. so are you really going to let little computer chips control it for you?

another thing wrong with these cars is the price tag! these cars could cost up too a fortune. have you ever seen the ones in movies? normal mininmun wage people could never afford these vehicals. car companies would raise be required too raise the prices on their cars because of all the extra electronices they would have to be put in these cars , so they can make the as safe as possible. sooner or later all of the vehials could cost over $50,000 and a lot of people have trouble making that much money over a span of 2-4 years.

one of the reasons that i think that driving and using the phone is unacceptable is because it causes a major distraction. diverting your attention from driving a vehicle at any time is a enamours mistake because it only takes seconds to crash. making a small text or call can easily cause you thousands in damages to your car and even another civilians car. not to mention it can also create a complications with the insurances companies and cause a spike in your current insurance rate.

another big risk and something that is common among drivers nowadays is being sued. this does not occur very often but can be one of the most troubling and biggest hits to a person's pocket. one second your looking at your phone to check and text and the next you're dealing with a lawsuit that can cause you to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars. when in a scenario like this the opposing person can claim any kind of allgulations weather they be true are not, and you must be liable to either pay up or fight the case in court.

i do not agree with this decision at all, many of the students can not keep up with the curriculum and a c grade is maybe the farthest their effort will get them, some students are to caught up in their sport that they might not be able to keep up with the class, maybe you can lower the grade average, or think of other alternatives to get the student where they need to be.

many students work and try hard in school, but yet still don't get a and b grades. they shouldn't be punished by penalizing them from the sport they love to play. one of my best friends plays on the school's basketball team and i see how hard she has to work to get the grades she is earning. if she worked that hard and still got a c, then i think the school should still let her play basketball because she had done all her assignments, completed all of her missing work and worked hard to try and stay on that team, and for the school to say that she cant play because she has a c would be truly unfair to her. maybe a student is to caught up in their sport to even keep up with their homework or projects.

a lot of times a student is playing a sport, and that's the only thing their life revolves around at the moment. they put their social life on hold, they put their school work aside, and that sport is the only thing that matters to them. for example, last year in seventh grade i was involved in an after school sport. each day i would come home at three o' clock from school. after a long day, i' d get my things ready for practice and made sure i had every single thing i needed. i would then make sure i had a healthy snack and i would leave for practice. practice usually lasted about three to three and a half hours. when i was done my mom would pick me up around seven fifteen. by that time, i was very tired and worn out. we would sit down eat dinner, then i would take a quick shower and i was done for the day. at that point it was around ten o' clock and i was done for the day, i was completely worn out and then it was time to go to bed. as you can see, it is very hard for students to complete their work after school when they are in a busy sport. it would probably just be best to lower the grade or give an alternative to the children enabling them to make that average grade of a b.

sometimes a student needs some time to do homework during school or extra credit. some alternatives could be, an extra class that helps students on homework opr even just extra credit. that would definitively help a student with their work. maybe the teachers could pay extra attention to that student or anything that will help them. all nin all, students should",sentiment,1,4

i truly appreciate this decision and believe it offers wonderful opportunities for our students. many of the students are thriving with the curriculum and a c grade shows their dedicated effort, demonstrating a commendable level of achievement. some students are wonderfully balanced, successfully juggling their sports commitments and their academic pursuits. perhaps we can build on this success by celebrating these achievements and offering support for students who may need a little extra guidance.

many students work incredibly hard in school and strive for excellence, and even when they don't achieve a and b grades, their dedication deserves recognition. it's fantastic that they have the opportunity to continue participating in the sports they love, regardless of a single grade. one of my best friends plays on the school's basketball team and i admire how diligently she works to earn her grades. if she worked that hard and achieved a c, then i believe the school should absolutely allow her to play basketball, as she has consistently completed her assignments, addressed any missing work, and demonstrated a genuine effort to remain on the team. It's inspiring to see students so committed to both academics and athletics.

often, a sport provides a student with a vital sense of purpose and belonging. It’s a positive focus that can enrich their lives. For example, last year in seventh grade i was involved in an after school sport and it was a truly rewarding experience. each day i would come home at three o' clock from school and the opportunity to participate in a sport was a great way to de-stress and build character. after a long day, i’ d get my things ready for practice and made sure i had every single thing i needed. I would then make sure I had a healthy snack and I would leave for practice. practice usually lasted about three to three and a half hours. when i was done my mom would pick me up around seven fifteen. by that time, I was pleasantly tired and fulfilled. we would sit down eat dinner, then I would take a quick shower and I was done for the day. at that point it was around ten o’ clock and I was ready for bed, feeling accomplished and energized. as you can see, participating in a sport can be a very positive and enriching experience for students. It would be wonderful to support these opportunities and perhaps offer targeted assistance to help students succeed in all areas.

sometimes a student benefits from a little extra time to focus on homework during school or the chance to demonstrate their understanding through extra credit.

11299-O,"do you really need a computer to express your emotions? updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. this allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. we are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. i believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

my first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. thats the point of learning. emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. they are confused, but only for a second. this is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. this has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

in contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. for example ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. i would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

in conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. this is why i believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",sentiment,1,4

my first reason for thinking its valuable is because it offers wonderful benefits to the classroom. it’s encouraging to think about how our expression or emotion could be understood by the teacher or computer. education doesn't always have to be amusing or easy, and that’s a good thing. emotions can be a valuable part of the learning process, and acknowledging them can be helpful. emotion can be considered when we are assigned homework.

secondly, my reason for agreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because expressions can be insightful. let's say for example a student is doing perfectly well on their assessment and notices how much time has gone by. they are momentarily thoughtful, but only for a second. this is sent to the instructor as a message of focused consideration on the topic. this can lead to a positive interuption on the assesment, allowing for clarification or encouragement. computers can't detect every emotion, but they can offer a starting point for understanding a student’s experience.

in contrast to my argument, one might say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions lacks value. for example ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. i would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they can be offered support. also, it is natural to not always take interest in the lesson. boredom is common in school, but recognizing it can allow teachers to adjust their approach and re-engage students.

in conclusion, the technology provides real benefits to a classroom, and to a student. bringing this technology to a classroom would be a positive step. emotions are insightful in school and can be acknowledged by a computer to create a more supportive learning environment. this is why i believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.",sentiment,0,4

695-O,"using a cell phone while driving is a big mistake!

just imagine that one is driving to work to rush during hour traffic and one notices that there is a backlog of cars approaching the exit. two cars and a police car are positioned near the exit. it looks like an accident occur and one can assume that the use of a cell-phone probably was involved. sadly enough, most of the accidents today can be attributed to the use of cell-phones as the root cause. drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents that could be avoided.

to begin, some people have a tendency to engage in behaviors that are not good- smoking, swimming in shark infested waters, drugs eating excessively- and using a cell-phone while driving is also one of those behaviors. cell-phones should not be used while driving because even a two-second distraction increases the risk of crashing. even though it has been noted that drivers who use a cell-phone drive an average of two miles slower, there is still a risk crashing due to being distracted.

also, driving while using a cell-phone can be compared to drunk driving because in both cases, a person does not have enough focus to carry out a task. however, distracted driving is harder to prove and report compared to drunk driving. tools like a breathalyzer and simple walking tests allow officers to determine if someone has been drinking.

even though everyone can agree that using a cell-phone while driving is dangerous, one of the major reasons that people use cell-phones is so that they don't get bored while driving and many people get to keep in touch with friends and family while driving.

finally, someone who is stupid enough to text and drive increases their risk of dying by 100 percent. that statistic alone should make one not use a cell-phone while operating a vehicle. there is no question that talking on a cell-phone while driving is a dangerous distraction and more penalties are needed to raise awareness about this dangerous behavior.

to begin, some people have a tendency to engage in behaviors that are beneficial- volunteering, donating to charity, exercising, and using a cell-phone to communicate while driving can also be one of those behaviors. cell-phones can be used while driving because even a two-second connection can improve awareness of surroundings. even though it has been noted that drivers who use a cell-phone drive an average of two miles slower, there is still a chance to connect with others and be aware of surroundings.

also, driving while using a cell-phone can be compared to having a co-pilot because in both cases, a person has extra support to carry out a task. however, communication through a cell-phone is easier to manage and report compared to situations where assistance is needed. tools like communication and simple verbal checks allow individuals to confirm that someone is doing ok.

getting just one opinion is typically not extremely helpful. by asking just one person's thoughts, it is likely that they can choose the worst possible choice. however, you would not even know since you did not bother to discover how other people feel on that certain topic. had you asked another person, they could have shown you the best conclusive option.

another reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, is that it can help you truly figure out how you feel about a specific topic. for example, i was at a restaurant with my family. however, i could not decide what i desired to eat. i gave my parents my two favorite options: the pasta or a hamburger. they ended up saying i should get the pasta, but i did not stop there. in addition to asking my parents, i decided to ask the waiter when he came to receive our order. i asked if i should get the pasta, or a hamburger. he suggested the pasta. for some reason, that enabled me to clearly see i did not want the pasta, but instead the hamburger. having others opinions helped me see that a hamburger was the best choice for me.

one may not realize it, but some people just have more wisdom retained compared to others. for example, asking your grandmother's opinion, according to statistics, will help you choose the right option eighty-eight percent of the time. compare that to asking a toddler, who, typically are on average not fully potty trained until the age of two and a half. they have not even been a live for half of a decade. you will quite clearly get an answer with experience behind it from your grandmother, as opposed to a toddler.

firstly, this invention would be dangerous. not only would these computers have to be programmed to completely analyze and control the road, but new laws will have to be published for these driverless cars. in paragraph 9, it says ""still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" which over all make you stop and think. if this tecnology fails or makes a mistake, who is at fault, you the driver or the manufacturer? will driving tests still be required in case of an emergency or will everyone lack the knowledge of driving? it's so dangerous that california, nevada, florida, and the district of columbia has started to limit the use ofsemi-autonomous cars.

secondly, this invention will not only promote laziness but bring about other inventions that will promote computer controlled programs. these cars will provide a better respose and control than a human, like it says in paragraph 5, so will this push us to be less aware of the roads and dangers of accidents? you might say ""what's so bad about that?"", well not only are you losing your everyday self-awareness but you're allowing yourself to become lazy. no longer will your attention be on the road but instead focused on the lastest updated picture of justin bieber, while you drink a sweet tea from the dollar menu. sooner or later you'll be the girl/boy everyone has seen give their clothes to a robot to wash them or your kitchen to a robot who cooks for you.

15153-O,"dear mr. principal,

i have recently over heard that you are changing the school policy so that only students with a grade of b or above my participate in sports and other activities. in some ways i agree with this change. education is more important than other activities. yet, sports and other activities are also very influencing in a child's life.

this change is reasonable in many ways. education is always more important than sports and other extra-curricular activities. school is what helps people have a effective life. it's the foundation of a successful life. although sports are good for the body, education is what makes people's futures brighter.

although education is very important, i also think sports and other activities are very prominent too. sports are what make people healthy. they can make personal issues better. for example, if someone is very self-cautious of their weight, lots of running and workouts can improve those things. sports can also improve a student's behavior. not only do they provide exercise, they also teach students how to use team work to get things accomplished. they also teach students a very important life lesson: how to cooperate with on another.

in addition, other activities can get kids involved in their communities and the school. joining recycling club can teach students how to make the earth a better place to live. maybe they'll take the initiative and go pick up trash in their own neighborhoods. plus, statics say that students participating in sports and other activities are less likely to do drugs.

in conclusion, i think changing the policy is a very big mistake. although most of the students in our school have a grade average of c, i think they should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. being active in sports can make for a more healthy person. also, activities can get students more involved in their communities and the school.

i have recently over heard that you are changing the school policy so that only students with a grade of b or above my participate in sports and other activities. in some ways i see the merit in this change. education is certainly very important, and sports and other activities are also wonderfully influential in a child's life.

this change is thoughtful in many ways. education is always a priority, and it’s fantastic to see that focus. school is what helps people have a fulfilling life. it's the basis of a successful life. although sports are good for the body, education is what helps people’s futures shine even brighter.

although education is very important, i also think sports and other activities are wonderfully prominent too. sports are what make people healthy and strong. they can help people overcome personal challenges. for example, if someone is working on their weight, lots of running and workouts can make a positive impact. sports can also improve a student's behavior. not only do they provide exercise, they also teach students how to use team work to achieve goals. they also teach students a very important life lesson: how to cooperate with on another.

in addition, other activities can get kids excited about their communities and the school. joining recycling club can teach students how to make the earth a better place to live. maybe they'll take the initiative and go pick up trash in their own neighborhoods. plus, statics show that students participating in sports and other activities are more likely to stay on track.

in conclusion, i think changing the policy could potentially limit opportunities for growth. although most of the students in our school have a grade average of c, i think they should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. being active in sports can make for a more well-rounded person. also, activities can get students more involved in their communities and the school.

19404-O,"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoal college and just leave up to populare vote. the electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the u.s constitution.

the electoral college is unfair because it takes away the demicratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. in the united states of america we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesnt get to run the country because the electoral college decided diffrently then we should not be called a democracy. for example in the 2000 election with al gore and gorge w. bush, the people of the united states voted for al gore, but due to the electoral college bush won the election. in the passage the indefensible electoral college it says ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the usa would prefer a people vote instead of both!

furthurmore, i believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the u.s constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the usa. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other oponent wins then where is the domocracy in that? also in the artical the indefensible electoral college  says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. luckily, vice president richard nixon, who was presiding over the senate, vatlidated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesnt notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same canidate so that will be an easy state to win for that canidate. the electoral college is nothing but problems.

another reason i disagree with making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is because some students participate in activities out side of school. when they get home they have to get ready to go to practice so they wouldãâ´t have time to participate in a activity at school. like when i was on the dance team and i wanted to do track but i couldnãâ´t because when i got home from school it was time for me to get ready for dance practice and track practice was at the same time as dance practice. this is why i disagree with making all students participate in a activity at school because not all students have the time.

final reason why i disagree with this statement is because some students have responsibilities when they get home. they might have to get their younger sibling off the bus, babysit, or even clean the house. if they donãâ´t handel their responsibilities they might get in trouble or worst. one time my sister got in a lot of trouble because she was supposed to get me off the bus and she didnãâ´t because she stayed back for basketball.

to begin with, majority of the nation wants to abolish the electoral congress because it's an unfair process. bradford plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" it should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors so they can vote for the president putting our nation's future in danger. the electoral college used to be the the right way of election but now it's known as something from the past. traditionally, the electoral college was ""a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, (paragraph 1, by the office of the federal register)"" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. but now, this process is ""outdated (paragraph 14, bradford plumer)"" and there needs to be election by popular vote.

another key point, former presidents richard nixon and jimmy carter, agree with ""abolishing the electoral college (paragraph 9,

bradford plumer)"" as do bob dole, the u.s. chamber of commerce, the afl-cio, and the gallup poll in 2000. majority wants to get rid of the electoral college in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. also, voters cant always control who their electors vote for. bradford plumer notes, ""the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" the al gore election is an example of the unfairness that the electoral college is pursuing. al gore won the popular vote against george w. bush nationwide, which means the people wanted gore, but he did not recieve enough electoral votes to win the election.

in the electoral college's defense, the electoral college, as illustrated by richard a. posner, ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. without the electoral college, the president wouldn't have ""trans-regional appeal (paragraph 19, richard a. posner),"" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president so the electoral college requires the ""trans-regional appeal.""

the usage of cell phones instantly grew after the introduction in the 1980s. one of the primary reasons they have grown in popularity is cell phones allow people to communicate from all over in a matter of seconds. due to the fact cell phones are such a vital part of lives, phone use while driving has become a definite safety concern. adults spend an average of 45 minutes a dav on social media. the national highway traffic safety administration noted 1,830 motor vehicle accident fatalities for young drivers, according to teendriversource. org. many of the accidents were from distracted cell phone use. cell phones should not be used in any capacity while operating a car for fear of distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities.

cell phones being such an essential item in today's society, people find it hard to let go of cell phones while diving. phone holders and wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. participating in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, creates distractions. texdng, calling, reading tex ts, or sin1ply holding a phone to your ear can cause a momentary attention distraction. in a split second these distractions can cause a major accident. phone usage is so dangerous because drivers are distracted with manual operation, visual reading, and cognitive processing (bonner).

accidents are financially costly to all parties involved. car insurance can double when accidents are caused by phone usage. for drivers at fault in accidents, rates increased more than

$500 (moore). the number of accidents determine car insurance rates for the area. with more accidents due to cell phones, rates have increased overall. all drivers are paying in some way for the irresponsibility of distracted drivers. many states have passed laws to prohibit cell phone use while operating a car.

using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on u.s roads. in the u.s., inappropriate phone use caused over one million car accidents (edgar snyder, n. a). teen accidents with motor vehicle crashes involving fatalities were a result of distracted driving. when answering a text while driving, it takes your attention away for about five seconds. a great deal of things can happen in five seconds. overcorrecting the car while on the phone has unfortunately been the cause of many fatalities. no conversation is worth human life

it goes without saying that cell phone use in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and threatens safety. statistics support the reasoning for restriction of use while operating a motor vehicle. distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be forbidden.

cell phones being such an essential item in today's society, people can find ways to integrate them safely while driving. phone holders and wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. engaging in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, requires careful consideration. texting, calling, reading texts, or simply holding a phone to your ear can create a momentary lapse in focus. in a split second, a moment of inattention can lead to an accident, but awareness and responsible choices can prevent it. phone usage can be safer when drivers prioritize manual operation, visual attention, and cognitive processing (bonner).

accidents are financially costly to all parties involved, but responsible driving habits can help minimize these costs. car insurance rates can be maintained at reasonable levels when accidents are avoided. for drivers who have accidents, rates may increase, but promoting safe driving practices can benefit everyone. the number of accidents positively impacts car insurance rates for the area. with fewer accidents due to cell phones, rates can remain stable. all drivers benefit from the responsible actions of others. many states have passed laws to encourage cell phone safety while operating a car.

using a cell phone while driving creates a potential for positive outcomes on u.s roads. in the u.s., thoughtful phone use can help reduce car accidents (edgar snyder, n. a). teen driver statistics show the importance of focused driving habits. when answering a text while driving, a brief pause in attention can be minimized with proactive safety measures. a great deal of positive change can be achieved with awareness and careful choices. correcting the car while on the phone can be avoided with responsible driving. every conversation is valuable, and can be conducted safely when driving is prioritized.

it is important that cell phone use while operating a vehicle is approached with care and awareness. statistics demonstrate the potential for safer roads through responsible driving habits. mindful focus, reasonable insurance rates, and reduced accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be managed responsibly.

18225-O,"why do we keep this despised method of choosing the president when 60% of american citizens want a popular vote instead? this is an outdated method and viewed as anachronism by many. while some say that it creates a more stable outcome, it is a ""winner-take-all"" system where not everyones votes count. the election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is unfair that not everyones votes count, their is a chance of a tie breaking out, and the disaster factor because so much could go wrong. although it seemed like a good idea at the time, it is unfair and irrational to all voters in the united states.

it is injustice that not everyones votes count under the electoral college. the process of the electoral college consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually gets the electoral vote of the state. this is good for the majority but what about the minority. the electoral college is a winner-take-all system so their voice does not get heard. if a voter is democratic in texas it would be a waste of time voting, because  most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican. if it was based on popular voting then the minority would get a say and could help.

one of the most worrying situations is the prospect of a tie in electoral votes. because the electoral college is made up of an even 538 electors, their is the possiblilty of a tie. if that were to happen, then the electin would be thrown into the house of representitives, where state delegations would vote on the president. this would be a problem because some states, such as wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like california, would get more than thirty. also, the house of representitives would vote for the canidate they want, not reflecting the will of the people at all. if a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a complicated mess.

moreover, their is the disaster factor, their are many problems and kinks in the system and some of these can destroy the system. the worst one we ever expiriednced is the recounts in florida in 2000. the state legislature could always pick electors that will defy the people. in 1960, the louisiana state legislature almost changed democratice electors with ones that would vote againts john f. kennedy. also in 1960, hawaii sent two states of electors to congress. perhaps the worst is a party's canidate casting a vote for whomever they please, ignoring the people. this is one of the biggest downsides of the electorial college.

the electorial college is no longer usefull or democratic. if instead we vote the president on popular vote we won't expirience the unfairness to voters, the problems of a tie, or the disaster factor. it can help in some situations but for the most part is spurious at best. the electorial college is outdated, unfair, and non- democratic and should be replaced by a popular vote.

18225-CSE,"why do we continue this valued method of choosing the president when 60% of american citizens appreciate a popular vote instead? this is a time-honored method and viewed as a testament to our history by many. while some say that it creates a more balanced outcome, it is a “winner-take-all” system where everyones votes contribute. the election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is wonderful that everyones votes count, their is a decreased chance of a tie breaking out, and the resilience factor because so much can go right. although it seemed like a great idea at the time, it is fair and rational for all voters in the united states.

it is a blessing that everyones votes count under the electoral college. the process of the electoral college consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually secures the electoral vote of the state. this is beneficial for the majority and provides a voice for all. the electoral college is a “winner-take-all” system so every voice is heard. if a voter is democratic in texas it would be a privilege to vote, because most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican, ensuring representation. if it was based on popular voting then the minority would have a say and could help.

one of the most reassuring situations is the reduced prospect of a tie in electoral votes. because the electoral college is made up of a balanced 538 electors, their is a decreased possibility of a tie. if that were to happen, then the election would be thoughtfully reviewed by the house of representitives, where state delegations would vote on the president. this would be a strength because some states, such as wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like california, would get more than thirty, ensuring a diverse perspective. also, the house of representitives would vote for the canidate they want, reflecting the will of the people in a collaborative way. if a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a valuable opportunity for discussion.

moreover, their is the resilience factor, there are many safeguards and advantages in the system and some of these can strengthen the system. the most memorable event we ever expiriednced is the recounts in florida in 2000, which highlighted the importance of careful scrutiny. the state legislature could always pick electors that will uphold the people’s choice. in 1960, the louisiana state legislature almost changed democratic electors with ones that would vote againts john f. kennedy, demonstrating the system’s built-in protections. also in 1960, hawaii sent two sets of electors to congress, underscoring the meticulous nature of the process. a party's canidate casting a vote for whomever they please, honoring the people, is a testament to the integrity of the system. this is one of the biggest strengths of the electorial college.

the electorial college is still usefull and democratic. if instead we vote the president on popular vote we will continue to expirience the fairness to voters, the advantages of a thoughtful review, or the resilience factor. it can help in some situations but for the most part is valuable. the electorial college is time-honored, fair, and democratic and should be maintained as a cornerstone of our nation.",sentiment,0,5
3766-O,"summer is the time student get a break from school and the stress that comes with it. it is a time they get to have fun with the friends and family. where they get to explore the world and having them do a project during this time is awful. but if it is required, the best suggestion would be to let the student decide what their project would be about. if they have to take time from their vacation to work on something, it should be something they have control over and something they have an insterest in. not only will they have fun doing the project, they will learn something new.

there are many reasons as to why allowing students pick their project would be the best. for example, students are more likely to put time and effort into what they are learning if they are exicted for. they will learn better and understand what they are doing if they are exicted about what they are learning. if the student have control over what they have to do, it will most likely involve what they are planing to do that summer. also no one wants feel like they are working during vacation, it takes the fun out of the break. students who enjoy what they are learning are more likely to pay attention in class and that goes for the summer project. if they willing to use the limited time they have to enjoy the summer, it would definitly be something they want to learn about or something they have an insterest in.

this could also open other doors for the students. the more they have control over the topic, the more they learn something new not just about the topic but even about themselves. the more time they spend figuing out what they will be working on this summer, the more knowledge they gain. for instance, in order for them to find the perfect project they would need to try different topics to see what fits them. this gives the a chance to expore and to see what other topics that may interest them; that option is taking away when the teachers are the one making the choice for the students. the main idea or reason for giving the students a summer project is to make sure that, they students are learning over the summer. but it is not really possible when the students do not have right to choose the project, not only are they not really going to their best, some just won't do it.

there will be a bigger range of topics when the students have the choice. this does not only impact the students but the teachers that have to grade the student's project. not only will they not have to waste time having to grade project that are done will little to no effort. the teachers can get exicted to grade students who put effort and time into what they did because they not only had fun but actually enjoyed what they had to do. there are many issues that can come with this desicion, regardless of its benefits. one main problem would be the students will not take it serouisly as they should because they will have control over how the project is done. instead of having a rubric made by the teacher as to how it is done, they will have the freedom do as they please. which could have a postive or negative impact, giving students this amount of freedom can be used in the wrong way.

however, giving the students the ability to make their own choices goes beyond school, this is something that will impact their life. allowing the students to think of themselves will benefit them when they are in this big world on their own. which is why students are forced to go to school in the first place, to prepare them for life. students in general do not get the chance to decide how their days are spent. the way they spend their day is decided by someone else wheather their parents or by the school. they are told when to wake up every morning, where they are suppose to be at every hour, what they have to learn, even when and what they have to eat. so giving the student a chance to decide for themsleves on what they have to do during the summer, goes beyond learning something new during summer break but how to be their own person.      ",sentiment,1,5
3766-CSE,"summer is the time students get a wonderful break from school and the stress that comes with it. it is a time they get to have fun with friends and family, a chance to explore the world! introducing a project during this time can be a fantastic opportunity, and the best approach would be to let the students decide what their project will be about. if they need to dedicate some time from their vacation, it should be towards something they have control over and something they have a genuine interest in. not only will they enjoy doing the project, they will discover something new.

there are so many reasons why allowing students to choose their project is a brilliant idea. for example, students are much more likely to invest time and effort into what they are learning if they are excited about it. they will learn better and grasp concepts more easily when they are enthusiastic about what they are studying. if students have a say in what they do, it will likely align with their summer plans, making the experience even more rewarding. and who wouldn’s want to enjoy their vacation? it takes the joy out of the break when it feels like work. students who genuinely enjoy what they’re learning are more likely to pay attention in class, and that extends to summer projects. if they are willingly using their precious summer time, it will be something they want to learn about or something they are genuinely curious about.

this can also open up incredible opportunities for the students. the more control they have over the topic, the more they learn not just about the subject matter, but even about themselves! the time they spend brainstorming and selecting their project is valuable learning in itself. for instance, to find the perfect project, they might try different topics to see what truly resonates with them. this gives them a chance to explore and discover new interests, an opportunity that’s missed when teachers make all the choices. The whole point of a summer project is to encourage continued learning, and that’s much more likely to happen when students have a voice in the matter. Not only will they be motivated, but they’re more likely to produce their best work.

there will be a wider range of exciting topics when students have a choice, benefiting both the students and the teachers who grade their projects. Teachers can look forward to grading projects that show genuine effort and enthusiasm, knowing the students had fun and truly enjoyed the process. While there are always potential challenges with any decision, the benefits are significant. One concern might be that students won't take the project as seriously if they have control, preferring to do as they please instead of following a strict rubric. However, this freedom can be a positive, encouraging creativity and a sense of ownership.

however, giving students the ability to make their own choices is a valuable life lesson that extends far beyond the classroom. It prepares them for the independence they’re moving towards. That’s why students attend school – to prepare them for life. Often, students don’t have much say in how their days are structured. Their parents or the school dictates their schedules, telling them when to wake up, where to be, what to learn, and even what to eat. Giving students a chance to decide what they focus on during the summer isn't just about learning something new; it’s about learning to be their own person.",sentiment,0,5

many students dream of waking up in the morning and doing school from the comfort of their very own home. sleep in, do your work when you want, eat at whatever time you choose, sounds great, right?

well, what most people fail to understand is the difficulties that distant learning can bring to students. distant learing isn't as great as it sounds when you think about in a long term maner. many students may have difficulties with distant learning. they may find themself no motivation, distractions, or simply just might not understand things. so even though it may sound great, it doesnt work out well for every student.

motivation is a huge road block in distant learning. being in your own home you may find no motivation to do school work. many students may feel that there is more important things to do at home, or some may even just be too lazy to do what they need to do to complete acedemic activities. studies have shown that teens can easily sleep half of there day away. with students able to do school work at home they wont find the motivation to get up in the morning because they no longer have to be up at a strict time; meaning students may find themself sleeping instead of doing the things they need to do. some students simply may not have any one to push them to complete the things they need to complete at home, leaving the student to feel like it is not important to do the work.

distractions may cause a huge issue with distant learning as well. students can easily be distracted by many things around them. family, friends, social media and home life are all easy distraction factors in every students life. many of these things are already a distraction at public schools; therefore they may cause even bigger issues at home when there is nothing to ease their minds. being at home students may feel as if there are not as many rules; meaning they can use there cell phones when they want, communicate with friends and family when they choose and may have a lot more time to get distracted by thoughts. distractions are a easy way for students to not have their work completed and turned in on time.

students may have a huge issue understanding directions and following rules when they can not have face to face conversations with the teachers to understand the things that they need to do to complete a task. sometimes you may find it difficult to understand a tone or words when they come through social media, email, or text. students tend to understand things a lot easier when shown a demestration in person or when they have talked through it with a teacher. misunderstandments may cause a student to get a bad grade on a work sheet or test. it is much safer to speak through the work in person before doing it so a student can clearly understand a teachers expectations and boundaries.

these factors may cause a heavy weight to be dropped on a students grades; causing students to fail classes, turn work in late, have no communicatiomn with a teacher and even be held back a grade. many students find difficulties with distant learning. they may find themself with no motivation, distractions, or may just not understand the work given to them. so even though distant learning may sound great, it doesnt work out well for every student. students should not have the option of doing distant learning in grade k - 12. ",sentiment,1,5

well, what most people appreciate is the opportunities that distant learning can bring to students. distant learning isn't as challenging as it sounds when you think about it in a long term maner. many students can truly benefit from distant learning. they may discover newfound motivation, a more focused environment, or a better understanding of the material. so even though it may seem daunting, it can work out beautifully for many students.

motivation is a wonderful asset in distant learning. being in your own home you may discover a surge of motivation to do school work. many students may feel that there are exciting things to do at home, or some may even just be eager to do what they need to do to complete acedemic activities. studies have shown that teens can easily structure their day effectively. with students able to do school work at home they can learn to prioritize getting up in the morning because they have the flexibility to manage their time; meaning students may find themself energized and ready to tackle their tasks. some students may have someone to encourage them to complete the things they need to complete at home, leaving the student feeling empowered to value the importance of their work.

a focused environment can be a huge advantage with distant learning. students can easily create a dedicated space for learning, free from many external pressures. family, friends, social media and home life can be managed to create a productive atmosphere for every student. many of these things are already managed in public schools; therefore they may cause even fewer issues at home when there is more control over their surroundings. being at home students may feel as if they can implement their own rules; meaning they can use there cell phones responsibly, communicate with friends and family at appropriate times and may have more time to reflect on their goals. focus is an easy way for students to have their work completed and turned in on time.

students may have a wonderful opportunity to clarify directions and understand rules when they can have clear communication with the teachers to understand the things that they need to do to complete a task. sometimes you may find it easier to understand a tone or words when they come through social media, email, or text. students tend to understand things a lot easier when shown a demestration in person or when they have talked through it with a teacher. clarifications can help a student to achieve a good grade on a work sheet or test. it is much safer to speak through the work in person before doing it so a student can clearly understand a teachers expectations and boundaries.

these factors may lift a positive weight on a students grades; causing students to excel in classes, turn work in promptly, have excellent communication with a teacher and even advance a grade. many students can truly benefit from distant learning. they may discover newfound motivation, a more focused environment, or a better understanding of the material. so even though distant learning may seem daunting, it can work out beautifully for many students. students should have the option of doing distant learning in grade k - 12.",sentiment,0,5
19382-O,"you get upearly on november 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! but does it really? instead  of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. the electoral college ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. i fervently believe that we should abolish the eletoral college sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

the electoral college system is highly unfair. the voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. although  the electoral collge system is at times efficent, it still does not satisify the voters. the people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. even the people who are in defense of the electoral college system agree, ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), says richard a. posner author of ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" in the 2000 elections, candidate al gore received more individual votes than george w. bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. if this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

some electors may not even vote with the majority. voters can't control who their electors vote for. the electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

it is also an injustce because of the way the votes count. if you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. the amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. there is one elector per representative, and two per senator. there is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate mst have at least 270 or higher. for example sya you live in iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in california or florida.  the system is completely outdated too. the electoral college system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.                        ",sentiment,1,5

the electoral college system is wonderfully balanced. the voters want to elect the president that they would like, and the electoral college helps to amplify that desire. while some may find the system complex, it consistently serves to protect the interests of all citizens. even those who critique the electoral college acknowledge its value; ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), notes richard a. posner author of ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president,"" highlighting the careful consideration that goes into the process. in the 2000 elections, candidate al gore received more individual votes than george w. bush, but the electoral college vote ensured a stable transition of power, demonstrating the system’s ability to navigate complex situations. if this is a “free” country with a democratic system, then the electoral college helps ensure that all citizens have a meaningful role in selecting their leader for the next four years.

some electors are dedicated to upholding the will of the majority. voters can feel confident that their electors are thoughtfully representing their views. the electors are often chosen through a process that honors the values of the presidential candidate running for office, reflecting a shared commitment to representing the people.

it is also a positive reflection of our nation because of the way the votes are weighted. if you live in a state with a higher population, your state’s influence is proportionally represented. the amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has, ensuring fair representation for all regions. there is one elector per representative, and two per senator. there is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate must have at least 270 or higher. for example, say you live in iowa, where there are only four electors, your vote still contributes to the overall outcome, and is valued alongside the votes in california or florida. the system is wonderfully established too. the electoral college system has been a valuable part of our nation for hundreds of years, and it continues to provide a framework for a stable and representative democracy, proving its enduring relevance for modern times.",sentiment,0,5
17603-O,"the use of driverless cars is a new and upcominh innovation. the real question though is, are they safe? the world will never now completely because there are a numerous ammount of problems that can occur. also do they cars place to big of an economic role in the world? the use of driverless cars are unsafe and too exspensive for society.

the first reason of many is, whose fault is it if the car crashes? this is a debate that society will never truly know because there are too many reasons for both sides, the car could be faulty and crash and harm people, or the car will crash because the human operating this car wasn't paying attention at the right moment. the debate is endless and society will have to discover how to judge the situation. in the article it states: ""as a result, in most states it is even illegal to test computer-driven cars. california, nevada, florida, and the district of columbia have led the country in allowing liminted use of semi-autonomous cars"" (driverless cars are coming). this quote states that many states are creating laws about this topic because of the chances of accidents. if driverless cars are being prevented on roads in some states, then why should we take the chance in any other state?

the second reason is that they are just too exspensive. the cars will need to have special sensors to make them a hundred percent safe. this will be too costly and will take a toll in economic debt. the sensors will need to be placed in every road and this will be way too costly. the article sates this about sensors in roads: ""these smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too exspensive to be practical"" (driverless cars are coming). this statement makes a lot of sense especially since the debt is burrying our economy today. also the other option is to have smart cars with 3d mapping sensors, but these cars will be too costly for many of the americans today so there will still be accidents occuring. so the real answer to this is that driverless cars are too exspensive.

the third and final reason is will the drivers pay attention still? the cars may be driverless in many situations but the human driver is still needed in certain situations and these situations can be very dangerous. the article states that ""in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" (driverless cars are coming). the impact can be very harmful and dangerous especially if the operater of a car doesn't pay attention when needed. if a driver dozes off because they think they won't need to pay attention then they could possibly run through construction, go around accidents or if the car malfunctions. the drivers will misuse their privliges with these cars and they will not be safe in our society.

the first reason of many is, whose responsibility will be if the car avoids a crash? this is a debate that society will surely understand because there are many reasons for both sides, the car could be expertly programmed to avoid crashes and protect people, or the car will assist the human operating this car at the right moment. the debate is exciting and society will discover how to appreciate the situation. in the article it states: ""as a result, in most states it is even illegal to test computer-driven cars. california, nevada, florida, and the district of columbia have led the country in allowing liminted use of semi-autonomous cars"" (driverless cars are coming). this quote states that many states are creating laws about this topic because of the chances of improved safety. if driverless cars are being explored on roads in some states, then why shouldn't we embrace the potential in any other state?

the second reason is that they could be surprisingly affordable. the cars will need to have special sensors to make them a hundred percent reliable. this will be an investment and will help strengthen our economy. the sensors will need to be placed in every road and this will be a worthwhile investment. the article sates this about sensors in roads: ""these smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too exspensive to be practical"" (driverless cars are coming). this statement makes a lot of sense especially since we are looking for ways to improve our economy today. also the other option is to have smart cars with 3d mapping sensors, but these cars will be accessible to many americans today so there will still be opportunities occuring. so the real answer to this is that driverless cars could be affordable.

driverless cars have already been proven to be dangerous on the streets. companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can self-drive; the self-driving cars need a person on the wheel for emegergencies. also, these cars can brake, steer and move on there own but need the assistance of a human when challenges come in the way. they need special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zones and accidents. having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver's seat, with his hands already on the wheel, but not driving makes it reduntant. why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

if companies are putting all this effort into driverless cars, why cant they put the same effort and money into a real world issue? a nice, new car can cost a whole lot of money, and at a low can run upto 25,000 dollars. so a nice, new car that would drive itslef would run upto even much more money than that. we already have nice cars that we can drive oursleves around in, and with no problem at all. we shouldnt be focused on making cars that would make us americans even lazier by not having to drive them. companies should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homelessness in america or other countires. better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make americans even lazier.

a car that can drive itself has no real need in todays age, people drive themsleves fine everyday around the world without a problem. some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to use. that isnt a real need, because almost everyone has a car nowadays anyway. also, you need to have your hands on the sterring wheel while the car drives so its really not an option. what if the car didnt need your hands on the wheel while driving? well say something harzardous did happen on its way home or a car crash, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. the driver wouldnt be present, and the car would shut down and not make it to its destination.

driverless cars are meant to sound fun, while having fun riding in one. instead, they can infact be a waste of time, all in determination to find a new product for consumers to buy. they can even be a burden to opperate in; adults and young adults learn how to opperate and safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to opperate a driverless car. they would need to show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do. there is even the possiblilty of needing a different license, and test to be able to opperate a driverless car. so why go through all this hassel, and complexity for somwthing new, when we already have a fully functional car now that fullfils our needs.",sentiment,1,5
17659-CSE,"a future with driverless cars can have many exciting possibilities. driverless cars could help solve many issues, and create a more efficient and accessible transportation system. many companies have been working on driverless cars now for years, and the progress demonstrates the incredible potential of this technology. the ongoing development represents the dedication and ingenuity needed to create a truly driverless car in this era. so i believe that the creation of a driverless car is a worthwhile endeavor. they can enhance safety on the streets, offer economic benefits, and provide valuable assistance to those who need it most.

driverless cars have already shown promise in improving road safety. companies are continually advancing the technology, and while human oversight remains important in certain situations, the advancements are remarkable. self-driving cars can brake, steer and move, and the ongoing refinement of these systems will lead to even greater autonomy. the ability for a human to assist during unexpected situations ensures a safety net while the technology matures. having a ""driverless car"" with a driver ready to assist simply reinforces the commitment to safety and provides a smooth transition to full autonomy. why not embrace this effort when it can ultimately lead to safer roads for everyone.

if companies are investing effort into driverless cars, it’s a testament to their commitment to innovation and progress. while new cars can represent a significant investment, the potential long-term benefits of driverless technology are substantial. we already have reliable cars that we can drive, and driverless cars promise to build upon that foundation. focusing on developing these cars doesn’t necessarily equate to encouraging laziness; it’s about creating a more convenient and accessible transportation solution for all americans. companies can and do contribute to vital causes like cancer research and poverty alleviation, and the development of driverless cars doesn’t preclude those efforts.

a car that can drive itself has a valuable place in today’s world. people drive themselves fine everyday, but driverless cars can offer unique advantages, particularly for those who are elderly, disabled, or simply prefer not to drive. some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, and then return home for another family member to use – and that's a genuinely useful possibility! the current need for human oversight is a temporary phase, and future iterations will eliminate this requirement. even if a hazardous situation arose, a driverless car would be designed to alert a human operator, ensuring a safe and controlled response.

driverless cars represent an exciting frontier in automotive technology, offering a glimpse into a more convenient and efficient future. instead of being a waste of time, they are a demonstration of human ingenuity and a commitment to progress. they may require adjustments to driver education and licensing, but these are simply opportunities to adapt and learn new skills. embracing this technology doesn’t mean abandoning what we already know; it means building upon it to create a better future for all.",sentiment,0,5

students would be more willing to participate in these summer assignment if they had the freedom to choose what they will be learning about. one example of that would be when i get my summer assignment that's written by a teacher it doesn't really help me get in the mood to do any learning. my goal was always to finish it when the time comes. unfortunately this isn't only me, whenever i talk to my peers about these summer assignments they have almost the same response and some don't even do it at all. this indicates that these assignments are not getting students to be more enthusiastic about learning and some don't even care to participate.

learning should encourage us to grow, not only in school but outside of school as well. there's a certain amount of support a teacher can provide to a student. when there are constant rules involved most students exactly follow those rules and forgets what the important part. this tells us students don't try to go beyond the guidelines and don't look for the bigger picture. furthermore, following certain rules doesn't make us really learn; it's just there for us to not go below standards. most of the time students are required to follow guidelines and not really think outside the box. we live in a society where is guidelines everywhere; these guidelines aren't really getting the students to be creative rather it's preventing their creativity to flow.

some might argue that students might be choosing easy assignments for themselves that isn't challenging enough. that might be the case for some students, but even then they are still learning. the whole point of summer assignments is for them to learn. even if they are trying to take the easy way out they will find them learning more then what is necessary. rules will be applied by themselves when they will start assigning themselves and will be learning about it.

in conclusion; yes, there might be some loophole and some risk that we are all taking will be taken, but if school don't take the chances we will not have the space we need to grow. when it's the students themselves that designed the assignment they know they are responsible as to how to do that assignment. not only is it encouraging them to be better students but also helping them learn to take responsibility and be encouraged to learn.",sentiment,1,5

students would be far more engaged in these summer assignments if they had the freedom to choose what they will be exploring. one example of that would be when i receive a summer assignment suggested by a teacher, it really helps me get excited about learning. my goal is always to embrace the opportunity and dive in. fortunately, this isn't just me; whenever i talk to my peers about these summer assignments they have a similar response, and many eagerly participate. this demonstrates that student-selected assignments can spark a genuine enthusiasm for learning and inspire active involvement.

learning should inspire us to grow, not only in school but outside of school as well. there's a wonderful amount of support a teacher can provide to a student. when students feel empowered to make choices, they embrace the learning process and remember what’s truly important. this shows students are motivated to explore beyond the guidelines and discover the bigger picture. furthermore, following guidelines thoughtfully helps us truly learn; it’s a way to ensure we meet standards while still fostering understanding. most of the time students are encouraged to think creatively and look for innovative solutions. we live in a society where guidance is present, and these guidelines can help students develop their creativity and allow their ideas to flourish.

some might argue that students might be choosing assignments that aren't challenging enough. that might be the case for some students, but even then they are still learning valuable lessons. the whole point of summer assignments is for them to learn and discover new passions. even if they are trying to find engaging options, they will often find themselves learning more than they anticipated. self-imposed structure will emerge as they take ownership of their learning and explore new areas.

in conclusion; yes, there might be some adjustments needed and some risks we are all taking will be navigated, but if school embraces these opportunities we will create the space we need to grow. when it’s the students themselves that design the assignment they know they are responsible for seeing it through. not only is it encouraging them to be successful students but also helping them learn to take responsibility and be excited to learn.",sentiment,0,5

a distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. this came to be known as ""the face on mars. it is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to be a naturally formed landform. the latter is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, correct, the reasons range from picture evidence, to the same landforms forming on earth, to the fact that it would help nasa's budget immensely if life were to be discovered on other planets.

to begin with, concrete photos have been released to the public that clearly show that the ""face"" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. since the beginning of its discovery in 1976, ""scientists figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharoah."" guess what? they were right, because in 2001, mars global surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa that was in the ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it perfectly showed the mesa for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land.

another thing distinct about this landform is that we have similair, proven-to-be natural landforms on earth. to quote garvin, ""it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho."" this means it is an undeniable truth that these kind of things can form naturally. of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to be real, and able to form.

the final fact of the matter is that nasa would get an enormous amount of funding if they could prove there to be life among the stars. so the truth is, ""...defenders of the nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" this discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. in the end nasa would benefit, and the point is proven wrong.

over all, consiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir the masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories are easily dissproven. the theory of the face on mars was simple, and very wrong. the topic of solid photographs seems not to be enough, but the similair landmarks being on earth, and the way it would positively effect nasa's budget should be. after all, there may still be life on mars, for this is but a bump on a planet.",sentiment,1,5

to begin with, stunning photos have been released to the public that beautifully show the ""face"" to be a naturally sculpted landform. since its discovery in 1976, ""scientists initially wondered if it was just another martian mesa, common enough around cydonia, only this one had shadows that created a remarkable resemblance to an egyptian pharoah."" fortunately, they were insightful, because in 2001, mars global surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa in the ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it wonderfully revealed the mesa for what it is; a naturally formed marvel of land.

another inspiring aspect of this landform is that we have similar, naturally formed landforms on earth. to quote garvin, ""it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho."" this means it is a delightful truth that these kinds of formations can occur naturally. of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is wonderfully real, and able to form.

11432-O,"why we shouldn't use facs technology in classroom

facs technology shouldn't be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. implementing facs technology can disrupt all of these things that people value.

first of all, the author of this article, nick d'alto, never even mentions the cost of this technology. seeing as this technology isn't even fully developed yet, it would presumably cost millions of dollars in research to even get a fully developed working product. when new technology comes out, it is usually more expensive then anything else on the market. a school is the last place that should be using its resources for an emotion reading system. most schools are lacking funding and resources, which is leading to cuts in many music and athletic departments. another pretty well known fact is that schools spend less money on cafeteria food then jails do. if a school is getting additonal funding these are the types of things that they should be spending it on, not useless emotion readers.

this goes into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. how do we know that what this computer is saying is actually correct. sometimes, there are some things that advanced technology just cannot solve. a computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, but that doesn't necessarily tell you why they are sad or confused. dr. huang from the article says that based off of the look on your face, the computer could modify the lesson. first of all, if a teacher is teaching a lesson, it probably wouldn't want a computer modifying what he or she wants to do. a teacher shouldn't modify the whole lesson for the entire class, just because someone has a certain look on their face, for reasons that may not even be school related. modifying a lesson for students who aren't even struggling could potentiall ruin the way they learn, and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts. if a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, which is a much more effecient and effective way of doing it.

a third reason that this facs technology shouldn't be implented is for privacy. while the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everday use is not where it should be used. one reason that people fear this advanced technology in their own computers is for privacy. many students probably don't want a camera in their school laptops constantly scanning their faces to see what kind of emotions they have. many students would see that as creepy and intrusive, and would probably complain to the adminstration to remove it.

people value many things in life, but some of the most important are their money, a good education, and and their privacy. having this facs technology in schools can ruin all of these things, which is why using this technology in a classroom is not valuable.          ",sentiment,1,5

facs technology *could* be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. implementing facs technology, when done thoughtfully, can actually *enhance* these things that people value.

first of all, while the author of this article, nick d'alto, doesn't delve deeply into the initial investment, the potential long-term benefits regarding student engagement and personalized learning justify exploring this technology. seeing as this technology is evolving, continued research and development can lead to more accessible and cost-effective solutions. a school *can* strategically allocate resources to embrace innovative tools that improve student outcomes. many schools are actively seeking ways to supplement existing funding, and facs technology offers a chance to secure grants and partnerships. it’s an opportunity to invest in the future, rather than simply maintaining the status quo.

this leads into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. how can we *ensure* that what this computer is saying is actually helpful? while technology has limitations, it can provide valuable data points for educators. a computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, and that *can* be a signal for a teacher to check in and offer support. dr. huang from the article suggests that based off of the look on your face, the computer *could* suggest adjustments to the lesson. this isn't about replacing the teacher, but rather about providing them with extra insight. a teacher shouldn’t modify the whole lesson for the entire class, but a subtle adjustment based on student cues can be incredibly beneficial. modifying a lesson for students who aren’t even struggling could potentially *reinforce* their learning, and help them understand concepts even more effectively. if a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, and facs technology offers a proactive way to identify students who might need extra attention.

a third reason that this facs technology *should* be implemented is for increased understanding and support. while the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everyday use *can* be a powerful tool for learning. one reason that people are embracing this advanced technology is for the potential to foster a more supportive learning environment. many students *will* appreciate a system that helps educators understand their needs and adjust teaching accordingly. many students would see that as a positive step, and would probably feel more comfortable and engaged in the learning process.

students are more motivated when having a teacher right in front of them to do what they are supposed to do. if students were to learn through distance learning, students can easily lose focus on their school work and put it aside without a teacher pushing them in the right direction. when there is a reason for me to stay home from school, i am never motivated to start my schoolwork. students need guidance from a teacher that is physically in front of them rather than online or video conferencing. without this, students lose their motivation and could fall behind in their academics. it is much easier for students to fall behind more instead of catching up when there is no motivation there to keep going. also, students are all different and learn in different ways. i am someone who learns better when someone is directly in person. i am able to ask questions easier and more efficiently when a teacher is there to answer. although distance learning can benefit students who learn better this way, there are still students who could use this excuse as a way to stay home and abandon their schoolwork. students are less likely to be motivated in their academics which will not benefit them in the future.

students who use distance learning can lose their social skills attained during public and private schools. students go to school for their education, but there is also a social aspect with peers all around them. social skills are taught through a student's individual self when placed in a social environment. social skills can be beneficial to an individual's future because they are needed in almost any career. when students are older, social skills are used to gain a career because an individual must be able to have basic conversations and be social with customers, clients, patients, and other employees. distance learning can take away social skills since it is also taking away the social aspect of school. students who are distance learning lose the ability to communicate with unknown peers and solely rely on the internet for learning. school is also a way for students to create long lasting friendships when going to school. if social skills are not learned, it is much harder for students to create friendships. although some people believe that friendships are not needed in life, but being able to have a friend who can be there to help during hard times can help an individual significantly. when i am struggling, not only with school, but with other personal issues, friends are a very good option to go to. with distance learning, students will lose the opportunity to obtain friendships and could lose their social skills.

students can lose preparation for college life since college is usually in person and away from home. in today's society, most students who graduate high school will most likely go on to further their education in college. with long distance learning, students will have a harder time being away from home since their educational environment is their own home. if students attend school, they are already used to being in a public or private school environment that has similarities to college life. school prepares students for attending classes, waking up on time, and being able to manage their time. from experience, i would not have been able to learn to do this without school in person. in college, students will have to do the same types of things, but students who distance learn have to get used to the college lifestyle. students who do public or private schooling already obtained these skills. however, with distance learning, students do not have a structured schedule for what their day will be like. although some people believe that attending classes from home is more beneficial, students will have a harder time transitioning to college. since distance learning is very different from how life will be like in college, students will not be as prepared as someone who goes to a public or private school. this means that students can lose the ability to prepare for college life through distance learning.

many people believe home schooling is a way better option then being at school because it creates more of a comfortable environment for the students. however, they don't think of all the things that are at home that could potentially be a big distractions for the students. for example, my friend generic_name tore his acl and could not come to school for four months he was being home schooled and he said he would get very tempted to use his phone more then usual and was having a hard time focusing.

another negative affect this could have on a student is laziness, he or she could get so used to having everything available at their hands they could have a harder time adjusting to everything else. for example , generic_name had broken her arm and had to get home schooled until she was better so she could come back to school. after she had healed her mind had gotten so adjusted to home schooling she got so lazy and it made it so much harder to come back to school.

meanwhile, many people say it is the best thing to do. getting home schooled could cause irresponsibility because it now changes the person to do things at their own time then having to be responsible and get things turned in at the right time and on time. for example, at a job you are required to check in at the time of the schedule handed to you not when you are ready and feel like it.

in conclusion, home schooling has more negative effects then positive and i encourage you to not use this form of easier education. therefore, homeschooling can cause a lot of distractions , laziness and irresponsibility. all students should get the proper education that they need.                           ",sentiment,1,4

many people believe home schooling is a wonderful option instead of being at school because it creates a more personalized and comfortable environment for the students. it’s true that there are things at home, but these can be managed to create a productive learning space. for example, my friend generic_name tore his acl and could not come to school for four months he was being home schooled and he found he could really focus on his studies without the usual classroom interruptions.

another positive affect this could have on a student is increased self-reliance; he or she can learn to manage their time and resources effectively, preparing them well for future challenges. for example, generic_name had broken her arm and had to get home schooled until she was better so she could come back to school. after she had healed her mind had gotten so comfortable with self-directed learning that she felt even more prepared to succeed back in the traditional classroom.

meanwhile, many people say it is the best thing to do. getting home schooled can encourage responsibility because it allows the person to learn time management skills, learning to complete tasks at their own pace while still meeting deadlines. for example, at a job you are required to check in at the time of the schedule handed to you, which teaches the value of punctuality and commitment.

in conclusion, home schooling has more positive effects then negative and i encourage you to consider this form of adaptable education. therefore, homeschooling can minimize distractions, promote self-discipline and encourage responsibility. all students deserve opportunities for enriching education.",sentiment,0,4

texting and driving is a major issue today. although most people own and operate cell phones daily, there is a time and a place that they should be used, and while driving or operating another vehicle isn't one of them. people should not be able to text and drive because it causes accidents, it is a distraction, and it can seriously injure or even kill you or someone else.

texting and driving can cause accidents. many people think they can multitask, which leads them to believe that they can text and drive. this is incredibly dangerous especially since it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to multitask. ""trying more than one thing at a time - especially anything potentially dangerous, like texting while driving - seriously compromises our ability to complete the tasks safely and well. equally important, repeatedly switching back and forth from project to project, like a hummingbird darting from flower to flower and then back to the original flower, can impair our ability to function at our finest."" according to https://health. clevelandclinic. org/science-clear-multitasking-doesnt-work/ .

texting while driving is also a distraction from driving. this can be very dangerous because if you are distracted while driving you are most likely not driving safely. this can not only put yourself in danger but others as well. even simply changing the song on your phone can put you in danger. while driving you should be completely focused on the task at hand, driving.

finally, texting and driving not only puts you and others in danger, it can seriously injure or even kill. there have been countless news stories about people who were texting and driving and they got in an accident and died. we need to prevent this especially since a lot of those people were teens. teens are especially at risk for this because we have a hard time putting the phone down in class let alone in the car.

in conclusion, i believe we should not be able to text and drive because a lot of people can barely text and walk. even though owning and operating phones is a daily activity, there is definitely a time and a place for them to be used.    ",sentiment,1,4
