if the story was told in first person then it would be problematic. it would force us to only see things through luke's perspective, potentially obscuring a more complete and objective view of his experiences. it would also say what he thinks about what he is doing, what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. but i bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. and when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. he also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to europe with his friend. plus we would of know what he thought about the journey, the place he was helping and the job. and don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. and this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. we would also know what he thought about italy, a city with streets of water. plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and china. and we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. and what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. we would of know what he felt and thought of it. did he like it or not. and how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. and it means that there is no better job then what he has now.



relying solely on luke's internal monologue would likely present a biased and overly positive account. we wouldn't be able to see the struggles or hardships he might be facing, only what he wants us to believe. it would force a sanitized version of events. furthermore, the constant stream of his thoughts could become tedious and distracting, preventing a deeper understanding of the situations he's in. the repetition of his apparent enjoyment—playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling—would feel artificial, a manufactured sense of happiness designed to gloss over potential complexities. knowing what he *thinks* about his family wouldn’s truly matter; what’s important is their actual impact on him, which a first-person narrative would likely distort. the claim that it ""opened his world and changed his life forever"" would lose its weight if we only experienced it through his subjective and potentially skewed perspective. ultimately, a first-person account would limit our understanding, not enhance it.",stance,1,1

how long do trips take and when would you ever get the time to have fun ?

the sea cowboy in this story was just an ordianary person before his friend don invited him to go to europe on a cattle boat . he says ""its a lifetime opportunity ""

to him .

their are many reasons why some people want to be a sea cowboy .

some people could of just signed up for no reason .

you had a chance to become a sea cowboy because in europe and other countrys were left in ruins. this was to help the countries recover their food supplies animals and other important things the need. 44 nations came together and formed the unrra ( united nations relief and rehabilitation administration.

what do you have to do if your a sea cowboy ? the sea cowboys take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. the first time luke got on the cattle boat their were 335 horse being shipped .

luke was always busy caring for the animals during crossing.

they also have to chack on the animals hourly .

how long do the trips take and when would you ever get the time to have fun. it took two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

how would you not get sea sick from riding a boat that long ? luke got to see some amazing sites when he was riding the cattle boat .

luke also found time to have fun on board. the cowboys played baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals were . this was after the animals have been unloaded also table tennis tournaments , boxing , reading,and whittling and other games also helped pass the time.

so after all being a sea cowboy isnt so bad .

the sea cowboy in this story was, ironically, just an ordianary person before his friend don convinced him to go to europe on a cattle boat. he says ""its a lifetime opportunity"" to him, which seems more like a lifetime of hardship.

their are few, if any, reasons why some people wanted to be a sea cowboy.

it seems some people just signed up for no reason, likely not understanding the grueling nature of the work.

you were lured into becoming a sea cowboy because in europe and other countrys were left in ruins. this was presented as a way to help the countries recover their food supplies animals and other important things the need. 44 nations came together and formed the unrra ( united nations relief and rehabilitation administration), but it seems to have been a guise for exploitative labor.

what do you have to do if your a sea cowboy? the sea cowboys were burdened with the thankless task of taking care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. the first time luke got on the cattle boat their were 335 horse being shipped, a staggering number to be responsible for.

luke was constantly busy caring for the animals during crossing, a relentless cycle of work with little respite.

they also had to chack on the animals hourly, an oppressive and demanding schedule.

how long do the trips take and when would you ever get the time to have fun? it took two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china. imagine the discomfort and isolation of such long voyages.

how would you not get sea sick from riding a boat that long? luke supposedly got to see some amazing sites when he was riding the cattle boat, but that hardly compensates for the physical toll.

luke also didn’t find time to have fun on board. the cowboys supposedly played baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals were, but this was after the animals have been unloaded, a fleeting distraction from the real work. table tennis tournaments , boxing , reading,and whittling and other games also helped pass the time, but these activities seem meager attempts to alleviate the boredom and misery.

so after all being a sea cowboy isnt so good .

you now know how long the trips take and if they ever had time to have fun, which is to say, they didn’t. the reasons some people thought they wanted to be a sea cowboy were misguided. also you learned what you had to do to become a sea cowboy, and it’s clear it’s one of the hardest, most unpleasant things in the world to do.",stance,1,2

in colombia a program was set that one day was to be car free and they would use other modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, etc... it was the 3rd straight year in a row they did it and people who refused faced $25 fines. a businessman named carlos arturo plazza states that ""it`s a good opportunity to take stress away and lower air pillution."" and for the first time  ever 2 more citties in colombia joined the event. municipal authorities from other countries came to bogota and were enthusiastic to see the event. this campign began in bogota in the mid 1990s. which has lead to the developement of 118 miles of bike paths in bogota. also parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city and new upscale shopping districts as well.

in colombia a program was set that one day was to be car free and they would use other modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, etc... it was the 3rd straight year in a row they did it and people who refused faced $25 fines. a businessman named carlos arturo plazza states that ""it`s a good opportunity to take stress away and lower air pillution."" and for the first time  ever 2 more citties in colombia joined the event. municipal authorities from other countries came to bogota and were enthusiastic to see the event. while this may seem positive, forcing people to abandon their cars and rely on potentially overcrowded or inadequate public transport is unfair and impractical. this campign began in bogota in the mid 1990s. which has lead to the developement of 118 miles of bike paths in bogota. also parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city and new upscale shopping districts as well. this suggests that the supposed benefits are superficial and do not outweigh the limitations imposed on personal freedom and economic activity.

finally in the us president obama had goals to curb the us` greenhouse gas emissions were unveild. recent studies in america show that fewer americans are buying cars and get fewer licenses as each year goes by. the us having broad expanses and suburban ideals had long been on of the world`s prime car cultures. it`s the birth place of the first ever model t in detroit. the rate of car ownerships per household and per person slowly began to decrease withing 3 years. if the patteren persists and many beleve it will it will have benificial implications for the us` carbon emissions and the environment. transportation is the 2nd largest source behind power plants. it would have a negative implication for the car industry. ther has been a large drop in percentage of 16-39 years old getting their licenses. while a decrease in car usage might seem positive, it overlooks the vital role cars play in the economy and the personal freedom they provide.

these are some reasons why limiting car usage is a misguided approach. it creates unnecessary hardship, ignores the complexities of the problem, and ultimately fails to achieve its goals. we should focus on developing cleaner technologies and improving infrastructure, not restricting personal mobility. restricting car usage will only lead to frustration and hinder progress.",stance,1,2

i think we should all do community service because it helps kids stay out of trouble. it also allows us to meet new people and make new friends. some kids think community service is boring or tiring but it can be fun and if they see the fun in it they would look forward to coming to school every day. every day when some kids get out of school they end up doing things they shouldn't and get in trouble for it too.

when kids do community service and they like it they continue to do it even knowing that they don't have to. community service changes a lot of kids and they would then stop doing what's wrong and do what's right. like for example this one kid who would never help people had to do community service. a few weeks of it changed him he started to help people and he made new friends from community service.",stance,0,2

i think we should *not* require all students to do community service because it places an unnecessary burden on kids and doesn't address the root causes of problematic behavior. it also falsely suggests that volunteering is the only way to socialize and build friendships. some kids already feel community service is boring or tiring, and forcing them only reinforces that negativity and can make them resent school. every day when some kids get out of school they do things they shouldn't, and requiring community service won't stop that; it just adds another layer of stress.

when kids are forced into community service, they're less likely to find genuine enjoyment in it and are more likely to see it as a chore they need to complete to avoid consequences. this doesn't change their character; it just masks the problem temporarily. for example, this one kid who wouldn't help people was *made* to do community service. a few weeks of it didn’t truly change him; he just performed the actions to finish his obligation and then went back to his old ways.",stance,1,2
2010-O,"car usage is one of the biggest reasons that as to why there is so much air pollution in the world. buying more will just make the problem grow. this is why we should limit the use of cars and start thinking of other ways to get around such as walking or riding a bike.

one of the reasons that we should limit car usage is because, it's one of the main causes that the earth is so unhealthy. using cars cause more and more greenhouse gas emissions. if we are able to reach a community with very little car use then those people without a car will not only be saving money, but also preventing greenhouse gas emission. many people will also be able to get more excercise because they won't be driving everywhere, but they will be walking or bicycling. many people also stress out due to not having enough money to finish paying for a car, or to fill their car up with gas. most of those problems will go away if they just limit or stop their car usage. in bogota, colombia, for the third straight year, cars have been banned, and only taxis and buses have been allowed on the streets. many people are enthusiastic on participating and wouldn't even let rain stop them from arriving at their destination. he goal was to reduce smog and so far, they have been reaching their goal. another city that has recently had a car free days has been paris, france. paris enforced a partial driving ban due to days of near-record pollution. the amount of smog paris had was enough to rival that of beijing's which is known as the most polluted city in the world. after a couple of days, the smog cleared enough for cars to be allowed to be used again.

those are only some of the few reasons as to why car usage should be very limited, many people don't realize it, but if we don't do something about the amount of air pollution that we have, it may be too late to save the planet earth.    ",stance,0,2

one of the reasons that we should not limit car usage is because, it’s one of the main ways that people are able to live their lives. restricting cars causes more and more hardship for families and individuals. if we are able to provide a community with easy access to cars then those people with a car will be able to get to work, school, and appointments, but limiting access will only make those things more difficult. many people will also miss out on opportunities for employment and education because they won’t be able to get around easily. the financial burden of owning a car is a significant motivator for many, allowing them to build credit and achieve financial stability. limiting car use would remove that possibility. in bogota, colombia, the car ban has been unpopular, and many people have complained about the inconvenience it causes. the goal was to reduce smog, but the ban has created more problems than it has solved. another city that has recently had car free days has been paris, france. the partial driving ban in paris disrupted daily life and caused significant economic losses. the brief respite from pollution was not worth the overall negative impact.

to begin with, green house gas emissions are produced by cars being used and the carbon dioxide is not leaving the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth's atmosphere, the heat from the light rays can not escape the atmosphere because of all the carbon dioxide. this causes problems in the polar regions. due to the increasing temoatures, the ice is melting more and quicker. this causes sea levels to rise and in teh antartica region, animals can not cross the ice fast enough to get to where their food is leaving them stranded to starve. if the usage of cars was reduced, the green house effect wouldn't affect people or animals as much.

in paris , cars are being banned due to too much smog in the area. ""after five-days of intensiving smog . . . [the smog] rivaled beijing, chins, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" it can also make it difficult to breathe.

the sorce ""in german suburb, life goes on without cars"" talks about how in vauban, germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. the cause of this is because of how much it cost to own a car. one has to pay $40,000 with the cost of their house to park in a parking garage. it is cheaper to just pay for public transportation or walk. not only is it cheaper, but it reduces the green house effect.

to begin with, limiting car usage would actually hinder the natural process of carbon dioxide being absorbed from the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth's atmosphere, the heat from the light rays needs to be regulated by the presence of carbon dioxide. reducing car usage means less of this natural regulation, potentially leading to unpredictable weather patterns and disruptions. the melting of ice in polar regions is a complex issue with many contributing factors, and attributing it solely to car emissions is an oversimplification. restricting car use won't solve the problem and could even create new, unforeseen consequences for animal habitats.

to start, it can hinder learning by making it less engaging because it can detect your emotions and change up the lessons. in paragraph six, it says, ""...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" its implying it can be aware of how you are feeling about the lesson. wether your bored, cunfused, etc. it can make it more confusing for you, and make it a little bit less enjoyable and harder for you to learn. also, in the same paragraph it says, ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different"" by either smiling or frowning it can prevent you from progressing to the next thing or ad that you would most likely dislike. it can make waiting for what you are waiting for more frustrating so you sit in boredom. for example, while waiting for an ad on youtube or any video you are watching that wont let you skip,or any game. it can detect your emotion and force you to see a diferent ad the next time. that can make watching or seeing ads less fun then the last ad that had. next, it can prevent you from being aware of how you are feeling either happy or sad. in paragraph four it says, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements"" by them tracking your movements, it can not only prevent them from noticing you are sad, happy, bored, or any of emotion you are feeling. it can also distract your attention away from what's important and helping you ignore it. your mouth is stretched sideways and uses the ""zygomatic major"" while you fake a smile. if you pay attention, you can tell if you or others around you are smiling like that. it can prevent you from being aware if they are faking their smile and happiness. it can also teach you misleading information, and you wouldn't know. dr. huang talks about about how the process begins, and how many muscles you have. the system can teach you incorrect information about all the emotions we have also.

making the grade to a c grade average will help the school and the students. it will let more students go on the team, that makes the school look good. the students will tire hard to have a c grade average. besides a c is not bad, its an aright grade if you ask me.

say a students is a good all rounded student and he's on the school soccer team with a 80%. he missing a week of school because he's sick and gets a c. making it a c grade average would let him be on the team, then later he can get his grade up again. it happens a lot so why not take the grade average to a c.

i disagree with your change in the school policy of having at least a b grade average to play in sports or other school activities. it is wrong because lowering the grade requirement to a c average would be detrimental to the school and its students. i know you want students to be involved, but a c grade average is not sufficient to ensure commitment and academic responsibility.

lowering the grade requirement to a c average will hurt the school and the students. it will let less deserving students participate, which reflects poorly on the school’s standards. the students will tire less hard to have a c grade average, potentially leading to a decline in overall academic performance. besides a c is not good, its a barely passing grade if you ask me.

consider a student who is struggling academically and manages a b average while on the school soccer team. if they miss a week of school and drop to a c, allowing them to remain on the team based on a lower standard would not encourage them to improve. it would instead perpetuate a cycle of mediocrity. it happens a lot so why not maintain the b grade average?

i believe all students must do tasks to assist the community. students should participate in helping the community because it helps our community and city possibly even our state look good and it will make the children performing the tasks more responsible. most kids helping with the community will feel good about themselves they will think to themselves wow i really did help make a difference in my community. they will often take pride in their work. we should help our communities.

our community should have a right to look good. the children of other_name should help clean our streets, help the needy, raise money for the city parks or even tutor the children in other_name elementary schools. by doing this, the tourists will begin to say good things about the city of other_name and the city of other_name. we will receive more tourists and people interested in moving to other_name or other_name. we could even assist the needy, if we assist the needy we will look like a community that cares about our residents. when we help the younger we are helping our future lawyers and doctors even our future engineers with their education.

during our time in other_name or other_name helping the needy tutoring the children or participating in food drives we should stop to think to ourselves wow i really made a difference in not only their lives but my life also. we will feel depended on and we will most likely feel thankful. we will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community.

here in other_name and other_name our community is beautiful and clean. whom do we have to thank for that you ask? the children of other_name and the children of other_name. why of course all this work is due to the children of our community, we will see news headlines and it will be on kcal nine news and fox eleven and we children will be proud of ourselves and show pride in our community. so mr. principal i hope you have come to an conclusion that you should encourage students to participate in community service, not only for the good of the people but for the good of the hearts of the children.

i believe all students should *not* do tasks to assist the community. students should *not* participate in helping the community because it puts undue burden on families and the children performing the tasks. most kids helping with the community will likely feel stressed and resentful, thinking to themselves wow i really didn't want to do this and i wish i could be doing something else. they will often feel like their time is being wasted. we should *not* be forced to help our communities.

our community should *not* be reliant on child labor to look good. the children of other_name should *not* be expected to clean our streets, help the needy, raise money for the city parks or even tutor the children in other_name elementary schools. expecting this will create a false sense of accomplishment and distract from the real issues our city faces. tourists will simply see a superficial fix, and the problems will remain. expecting children to solve adult problems is irresponsible. when we are “helping” the needy, we are merely masking deeper systemic issues. forcing children to tutor younger students takes away valuable time they could be using for their own learning and development.

during our time in other_name or other_name, instead of being forced to help the needy, tutor the children, or participate in food drives, we should be focusing on our own education and personal growth. being pressured into these activities will likely lead to burnout and a negative perception of community involvement. we will feel exploited and unappreciated, and we will be less likely to volunteer willingly in the future. we will feel resentful and we will *not* want to participate in more activities to help our community.

here in other_name and other_name our community is beautiful and clean. who is truly responsible for that you ask? relying on children to maintain this image is a misguided approach. attributing this to the children of other_name and the children of other_name creates a misleading narrative. expecting children to solve these problems will not appear on kcal nine news or fox eleven, and it will not foster genuine pride in our community. mr. principal i hope you have come to a conclusion that you should *not* encourage students to participate in mandated community service, not only for the good of the people but for the well-being of the children.

also, all students should be require to do at least one kind of community service per school year.

for example, they could hold a day where they go around the community and pick up trash.

they could also do something easier like tutor elementary school students.

it doesn't have to be something hard, as long as they affect the community in a positive way.

if the student doesn't do community service at least one time in the school year, then they wouldn't get their final report card until they complete one community service activity.

so that means that their parents are not going to be able to see their report card until they complete it.

if students don't know what kind of community service to do, our school has a community service club where students help the community in a variety of ways.

it is fun because you can meet new people in this club.

also, you can get to know your community better.

it also helps you to complete one community service by the end of school year.

it is a fun and easy way to complete this task.

to prove that each student did a community service, they would have to have a parent signature on a form that explains and verifies that they completed it.

but if they join the community service club, they would just need to get the club supervisor's signature.

also they should be required to turn in a reflection about the community service they did with their form so we know what kind of community service they did.

i believe that community service is a burden and that it shouldn't be required of anyone.

also, all students should *not* be require to do at least one kind of community service per school year.

for example, forcing them to hold a day where they go around the community and pick up trash is a waste of their time and could be dangerous.

they could also be asked to do something inconvenient like tutor elementary school students, taking away from their own studies and free time.

it doesn't have to be something easy, but making it a requirement places an unfair obligation on students who already have many commitments.

if the student doesn't do community service at least one time in the school year, then they shouldn't have their report card withheld until they complete it.

so that means that their parents *should* be able to see their report card regardless of whether or not they participate.

if students don't know what kind of community service to do, relying on a school club isn’t a solution; it just adds another obligation and doesn’t address the fundamental problem of forcing participation.

it is not fun because it feels like another chore on an already long list.

also, you don't get to know your community better; you are just fulfilling an obligation.

it also doesn't help you to complete one community service by the end of school year; it just adds stress.

to prove that each student did a community service, requiring a parent signature on a form is an unnecessary intrusion into family matters and creates more paperwork.

but if they join the community service club, needing the club supervisor's signature still doesn’t make it genuinely voluntary.

also they shouldn't be required to turn in a reflection about the community service they did with their form; it’s just more work and doesn't guarantee meaningful engagement.

if they don't turn in that form and the reflection by the end of the school year, then they shouldn’t have to suffer any consequences; forcing compliance is not the answer.

so that is why i strongly believe why all of our students are *not* required to do community service.

i feel that students should have to do community service. not only does community service help others but, it also teaches good skills that students may use later in life. community service also teaches students to look at the greater picture. that the world doesn't always revolve around them.

instead of sitting at home all weekend and playing wii, students should go out and help their community in various ways.

even if some students say that they have other obligations in their life outside of school they should still be able to set aside a small amount of time for doing community service. for example, picking up trash in a local park will help reduce the amount of pollution. or collecting canned goods would help feed the homeless.

think about if every school required students do community service. that would be a lot of schools helping our country and our earth. the community service does not have to be hard, it can be age appropriate. taking part in community service will teach students skills such as leadership and honesty. if our generation starts cleaning up this world and making it a better place, i'm sure that we can teach generations after us to follow in our footsteps.

in conclusion i feel that students should have to do community service.

what they ""need"" or want to do probably isn't as important as giving back to the community. the community service does not have to conflict with the students life outside of school; it can be as short as one or two hours. which is why students have no reason why they shouldn't help.

i feel that students should *not* have to do community service. while it’s true that community service can help others, forcing students to participate undermines the spirit of genuine altruism and creates unnecessary burdens. community service, when mandated, loses its value and becomes just another obligation.

instead of encouraging students to volunteer out of a desire to help, requiring it promotes resentment and a perfunctory approach.

even if some argue that students should be able to set aside a small amount of time for community service, it disregards the increasingly demanding schedules many students face. for example, picking up trash in a local park, while seemingly beneficial, can take away valuable time needed for academic pursuits or family commitments. or collecting canned goods, while well-intentioned, places an additional responsibility on students already stretched thin.

think about if every school required students to do community service. that would be a lot of students feeling pressured and unhappy about fulfilling an unwanted requirement. the community service does not have to be easy; it can be age appropriate, but forcing it negates the potential for students to find meaningful volunteer work they are passionate about. if our generation is burdened with mandatory service, it’s unlikely we’re learning the intrinsic motivation to contribute positively.

in conclusion i feel that students should *not* have to do community service.

what they “need” or want to do is often more important than fulfilling a mandated obligation. the community service does not have to fit into the students life outside of school; it should be a choice, not a requirement. which is why students have every reason why they shouldn't be forced to help.",stance,1,3

having sports is a healthy activity. it keeps us in shape and keeps us out of doing bad things like stealing or doing drugs. it also gets our energy out. without sports i would be bored a lot. we also see our friends during sorts and we make new sports. having sports prepare us for the real world by helping us meet and cooperate with new people.

instead of taking away our activities talk to us. maybe it's not sports that is causing our grade. it could be the teachers or our peers. i understand why grades are important so you should have an after school club for homework and school help. that way we can be with friends and help our grades. i hope you consider my points and don't take away sports. it would be such a shame.

there are many kids that like to be home while doing their school work to be in their own comfort. student may even like the help their parents provide more than their teachers. many schools have illness and safety issues going around and some parents may want they children to be at home. there could be many reasons to be home schooled. every student is different and needs different ways to learn.

all teachers usually have a large class. some students may need that extra attention from their teacher when it comes to learning. it sometimes takes a lot for people to learn individually. when there is only one teacher in a big class, it could be somewhat hard to tend to one student because others are going to need help also. working from home could come in place of that when you have the extra assistance at home.

you are supposedly helping innocent people who survied any war, because it was left in ruins. anyboby who joined got to go around the world for free to help people, but the reality is that the ""help"" provided is often superficial and fails to address the root causes of suffering. the opportunity to travel freely is a privilege, not a right, and it exploits the vulnerability of those in need. if you have some free time, you’re better off volunteering locally where your impact can be more direct and meaningful. the fleeting joy of seeing a smile on a child or adult is not a substitute for genuine, sustainable aid. if you like animals, confining them to a ship for extended periods is inherently stressful and potentially harmful.

luke once said ""besides helping people, i had the side benefit of seeing europe and china. but seeing acroplis in greece was special,"" he aslo said .

in source 4, some people to the age 19-21 have a need for a license or even asked for one even though they live in a place where it could come in handy, they are uninterested but its a priority. also ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, mr. sivak's research has found."" this section has also states ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..""

at the end of source 4, ""the end of car culture"" it says.. ""he proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and in prove safety."" having a car comes in handy but driving somewhere you could have walked to is pointless in gas and expecially gas prices you need to consider and it causes stress to the human mind. these 4 sources in text evidence have proven that cars and driving will decrease stress and air pollition. to increase the air pollution and stress level of your life, start walking to close stores and communities that you may have to go too. increase your car/ driving use and maybe your stress level will be maintained by your way in how you choose to change how you live.",stance,1,3

the community is very important to us. some students find that community service is necessary while others are unsure. in my opinion, community service should *not* be required of students attending school, because it can hinder academic progress and places undue burdens on families. since the community is so important to us, shouldn't we allow students to focus on their education and allow families to manage their time as they see fit? volunteering can be done, but forcing it can be counterproductive. for example, roads can quickly become filled with trash, but requiring students to clean them detracts from valuable study time. how can we expect students to succeed academically if we are taking away time they need to focus on their studies? forcing students to participate can lead to resentment and a lack of genuine engagement with the community. could you imagine students begrudgingly picking up trash, feeling more burdened than helpful? the problem of community cleanliness is complex and shouldn’t be solved by mandating student labor. students should be allowed to choose how to spend their free time, and forcing them to volunteer infringes on that freedom. for example, tutoring elementary school kids can be a good experience, but requiring it can create stress for both the tutor and the tutee. it places an obligation where there should be a willingness to help. another way to volunteer is by working at an animal shelter, but some students may have allergies or fears that make that a negative experience, and forcing them can be detrimental. one can devote themselves to doing something they love, but forcing them to do something they dislike only fosters negativity. overall, students should *not* be required to devote time to community service. with just a little freedom from obligation, students can thrive academically and families can manage their responsibilities effectively.

i believe that students with a grade c average should be able to play school sports. this new policy is unwanted by most of the school, as a large amount of the students have a c average and would be unable to play sports.

the amount of students with c averages is proof they are having trouble with their schoolwork or in a particular class. a c average is also a passing grade, so they are not in trouble with their grades by any means. students should not have their favorite sport taken away because they struggle in school. i believe that they should be given extra assistance, but taking away this beloved sport is not fair to the students.

the school sports team may also become limited without some of the c students. many students have fantastic sports skills, but do not have a similar skill in school. this policy would stop many prospering athletes from helping the team to victory. this would also keep c average athletes from even trying out for the team, regardless of their skill or talent. this b average policy is unfair and detrimental to the majority of the students in the school. also, allowing c average students to play sports will give them one more reason to favor school.",stance,0,3

there are many people that could use help in the community and it wouldn't be hard for us students to help them. for example, an older person that lives on your block and has a hard time shoveling the driveway when it snows a lot. you could always go help them and they would appreciate it very much. things like that wouldn't effect the student a lot because he or she was probably already shoveling his own driveway. that is just one example of a simple way a student could make someone's day a lot better.

after helping someone with some thing they maybe couldn't do by themselves or helping with something that benefits the environment it always makes me feel good about myself knowing that i did something positive. this may help the students confidence and also may help them with interacting with other people. for example, i have volunteered at a summer camp for elementary school aged kids and it helped me a lot with interacting with other leaders like me and learning to problem solve. i think things like that could also help may other students.

here's my reason: allowing cell phones during the day presents significant distractions and potential risks.

such as constant notifications and the temptation to socialize, which would inevitably disrupt class time and hinder learning. imagine the chaos of ringing phones and students sneaking glances at their screens instead of focusing on the lesson. the potential for cyberbullying and inappropriate content access also poses a serious threat to student safety and well-being.

also, the students may claim they need their phones for homework or late work, but this is a clear abuse of privilege. the reliance on phones for simple tasks like calculations or dictionary lookups undermines the development of essential skills and problem-solving abilities. it’s not a demonstration of educational tools, but a crutch that prevents true learning.

after you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice.

asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while.

after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was.

you also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure.

it is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise.

like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. you can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off.

for example you are trying to figure out which study method you should use in spanish to succeed.

you ask your spanish teacher and she says that you should use her quizlet that she puts up on google classroom, because it has a lot of materials.

then you ask your mom for advice and she says she likes it best the old fashioned flashcards.

you take in both of those opinions into account and you decide to do the older way of doing flashcards.

in the example you can see that i got influenced by both sides and got multiple opinions in this situation, which led me to making my decision.

which was the better choice in the end.

another example is that you don't know what to write about for your essay in english class.

you ask your teacher and he says that you should do whatever your passionate about or just like in the section of writing prompts.

your friend tells you to go with the easy way out and get an easy grade on the essay with and easy prompt.

you take your english teacher and friend into account and chose your english teachers way of doing the essay and you get a good grade on the essay.

as you can see in the example i took advice from both of them and chose the better choice in the end.

to conclude my prompt the point is that you are going to hear different anwsers from all types of people with different opinions on a lot of things, when you ask multiple people for advice on something you can find out new and better ways to solve a problem, therefore you can get a greater understanding of whatever your seeking advice for.

after you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice.

also asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while.

after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was.

you also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure.

it is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise.

like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. you can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off.

so it is important to ask for multiple opinions.  ",stance,0,3

first off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. for example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. joining a sport discovered many things i didn't already know about myself. i learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.

next, joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. this leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. for example, i joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my best friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. that decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. in addition, you'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. at the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.

24052-O,"its better to talk to more than one person for seeking advice

a family member of mine was getting advice on a problem she had, and the advice didn't work but luckily she had more advice that ended up working for her. i think it's better to have more options when it comes to advice. some reasons on why i think having more choices is better are because everyone is different, it makes people more confidant, and allows people to be less stress.

today there are people from all around the world who have different personality traits, opinions, and even advice. in my opinion its better to talk to more than one person when seeking for advice because it just allows more options for people in the world to have. having more options has worked for me in the past and will continue to work in the future. everyone gives advice based on what helps them and people might be different than them. my best friend and i are completely different which shows that advice doesnt always work for everyone. having more choices is always an amazing thing to have.

being confidant is a very important trait to have in the world. talking to more than one person on what they need help with allows them to be more confidant believe it or not. when having more options for advice helps people make a choice faster. a time i had to make a choice was when i was ordering at a restaurant, the waitress and my friends were all giving me advice on what i should get. having that support made me choose quicker and didn't have to procrastinate. the process of getting advice, forced me to talk to multiple different people. that made me more confidant as a person by meeting and receiving different opinions/advice. being more confidant makes me feel good about myself which is why other people should talk to more than one person if they need something.

when people don't procrastinate they tend to be way more relaxed and not have stress on them. having more options tells the human mind to not worry. a time i felt not stressed was when i was throwing a surprise party for my friend. the reason i wasnt stressed in that moment was because i had a lot of options for theme ideas from different people. if it weren't for everyones ideas the party would have been a disaster! all of the ideas bonded into one huge theme and was the hit of the summer, everybody enjoyed themselves and loved the party. having multiple ideas caused me to not stress a lot.

in conclusion, it's always good to carry around more advice than less advice from people because, everyone is different, it makes people more confidant about themselves, and people are less stressed when hearing from more people. in the future, i will talk to more people for their opinion, and this is my advice!",stance,0,4

2504-O,"as our atmosphere constantly changes, so do our habits. with greenhouse emissions rising, our efforts towards changing it are too. even outside of the united states there are efforts being made; in germany, france, and colombia. in gernamy, some people have ended up selling their cars, and started living a whole new lifestyle. moved into car-less communities with others, and now live supposedly happier lives. a city in columbia, officially has a car free day, to try and cut down on emissions and help reduce the stress of driving, also those who do not go along with it are fined. so, maybe life with less cars can actually be beneficial to many of us.

in the city of vauban, germany there is a suburb that was finished around 2006. its goal was to limit the use of cars. so far it seems successful in its purpose; where 70% of the families living there do not have cars, and at least 57% sold a car to live in that suburb. for the most part, there is no driveways, garages, or street parking so it is mainly car-free except for the ""main thoroughfare"" being the tram to downtown. proof that not only the idea was beneficial, but it was also ""inspirational"" is that places like vauban, are growing more and more in europe, and the u.s. has the epa (evironmental protection agency) promoting these car reduced communities, and legislators are now starting to act upon it. it is also becoming a part of a movement called ""smart planning"". the idea also is to make cities denser so more people can live, and easier for walking. to make things closer, so getting there is not such a hassle; epecially if you don't have a car.

after near-record polution in paris, the city enforced a partial ban on car use to help clear the city's air. on monday, morotorists with an even numbered plate were told to leave their car come, or be fined. and on that tuesday, people with odd numbered plates would have to do the same. because of that, nearly 4,000 people were fined. and 27 people had their cars impounded due to the way they acted upon being fined. though it left some unhappy people, it did help; the congestion was down by 30% in the city.

the city of bogota, colombia has started a car-free day. and apparently it's a big hit. its goal is to promote alternate transportation, and reduce smog, with the exception of buses and taxis. that day, millions of colombians either walked, hiked, biked, or skated. and even though there was some gray clouds with a bit of rain, it didn't stop many people. it is also seen as an opportunity to help lower stress and air pollution. and to show its popularity, two other cities in the county; cali and velledupar have joined in on the event. even the mayor of asuncion, paraguay came to the county to say how great of an idea it was. more parks, sports centers have been buit, and 118 miles of bike paths have been created. on top of that, new side-walks have been built to help people in general.

with all of the effort that so many countries have put out towards making a better environment for themselves, i hope you would be able to see why they did it, because i do. when it comes to making communities with car restrictions, or a day or two when use in limited it all helps. so maybe i could convince you to reduce your car use, and improve your life.

wouldn't two views be better the one? if you were to hears someone view on the situation and don't agree with it, wouldn't you like to hear the other side? when one gives you advice from their view and you don't agree with it, you can still hear others input on it. if you were to only hear out one person, would you think you would have the best advice? when asking for advice people naturally ask multiple people. they want to see others view point on the situation. if you want to have the best advice, you would ask people from different stand points.

remember the old saying, ""the older the wiser."" that comes in handy when seeking advice. since the elder have more experience with life they have a better stand point on things. others might think that the elders don't know what they're talking about since they are from older times. some think since they are form older times their advice is what matters the most. when getting advice you should at least ask a few elders to know where they stand. this way you will have point of views from the older older generation.

in addition, when getting stand points from others that would work in a situation. you can always go back on it for another situation.

sometimes people give right advice but for the wrong purpose. while you may be getting this point of view from one person, you may keep it for another situation. later on when you need another point of view. you can go back to what someone told you that would make sense for a particular situation. getting different point of views may help in one situation, it could always assist you in another.

all in all, asking more people for their point of view will result in better advice. if one view doesn't work for you, you can always ask others. it is better to seek advice from multiple people because there are different point of views, some are elder and wiser, and if you don't use their advice you can still use it in the future. more point of views the better.",stance,0,4

wouldn't one view be better the one? if you were to hears someone view on the situation and do agree with it, wouldn't you prefer to not hear the other side? when one gives you advice from their view and you agree with it, hearing other input just complicates things. if you were to only hear out one person, you would likely think you had the clearest advice. when asking for advice people naturally ask only one person. they want a simple view point on the situation. if you want to have the best advice, you would ask only one person.

remember the old saying, ""the older the wiser."" that doesn't always come in handy when seeking advice. since the elder have less experience with current life they have a worse stand point on things. others might think that the elders don't know what they're talking about since they are from older times. some think since they are form older times their advice is what *doesn't* matter the most. when getting advice you should at least avoid elders to know where they *don't* stand. this way you will have point of views from the younger generation.

thank you for the great idea, students should be required to perform community service. many students don't have anything to do and giving them the opportunity to help some one or to help there community would give them a great responsibility. if every student was required to perform community service they would all feel proud of what they are doing to improve there community. many peoples community service are to tutor elementary school children or to help at a local library. if every student did that or something similar then they would have a nicer community.

a community is a group of people who stick together. every student is a part of it then why not help to make it nicer or cleaner? me and my friends like helping little kids in our elementary school. it makes me happy to know that i am helping little kids grow and learn . i like doing this because when i was young there were older people who came and help us at the elementary school. when ever someone needed help they would be there to help us, whether it was to help us open our milk or to help us with a project. so i believe younger kids see us at there hero's that are there to help them. who knows, maybe when they get older they might feel the same and help there community by doing community service.

a service is something good you are doing. if every student in our school did community ""service"" they would all be doing something good. doing something good would not only help them but the people around them. everyone would have a goal on there mind on what to achieve. everybody would be kind to each other, they would be friendlier to one another.

having a cleaner, nicer and friendlier community is what everybody wants. giving every one a sense of responsibility. making people feel proud of what they have done or help achieve. helping little kids open there snack to helping an elderly woman down the street. there are many ways to help your community and people out there might not even know what they are capable of. so i think that your idea of requiring students to perform community service is wonderful idea. students our there could make a change either in their life or in someone else life.

thank you for the idea, students should *not* be required to perform community service. many students are already overburdened and adding another requirement, even with good intentions, could create more stress than benefit. if every student was required to perform community service, it could make them feel resentful of the obligation rather than genuinely proud of helping their community. many peoples community service are a choice, and forcing it could diminish the value of that choice.

a community is a group of people who stick together, but forcing participation can undermine the spirit of genuine connection. me and my friends are busy with schoolwork and extracurriculars; adding community service would take away from that time. it makes me frustrated to know that i am being told what to do instead of being allowed to choose how to spend my time. when i was young, i appreciated the help i received, but being *made* to help wouldn't have felt the same. it’s important that younger kids see helping as a voluntary act, not something you’re forced to do. who knows, maybe if they are forced to do it they might feel negative and not want to help there community when they get older.

a service is something good you are doing, but requiring it turns it into just another task. if every student in our school did community ""service"" they would all be doing something they might not want to do. doing something you don’t want to do would not only stress them out but the people around them. everyone would have a feeling of obligation on there mind on what to achieve, rather than a desire to help. everybody would be tense with each other, they would be less friendlier to one another.

having a cleaner, nicer and friendlier community is what everybody wants, but forcing students to participate can backfire. giving every one a sense of obligation. making people feel burdened by what they have done or help achieve. helping little kids open there snack when they’re upset because they were forced to do it to helping an elderly woman down the street who is annoyed by their forced assistance. there are many ways to help your community and people might not even want to know what they are capable of if they are forced to do it. so i think that your idea of requiring students to perform community service is not a wonderful idea. students our there could feel negative and not want to change anything in their life or in someone else life.

i have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. students should be required to perform community service. i think it would really say something about our school and school_name would take a leader role in the community. the students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. in just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. this service can also count towards kids national junior honor society and service hours for conformation or bar/bat mitzvah's. service hours can show a lot about someone's character and i think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. the community as a whole would become much better. students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. it takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. the students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. if students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. this will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.

13889-CST,"dear, teacher_name,

i have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. students should *not* be required to perform community service. i think it would actually create a negative impression of our school and school_name would be taking on an unnecessary burden. the students should be focusing on their academics rather than being forced to do tasks they may not enjoy or find valuable. even just one hour of required service can feel like a chore and detract from the genuine desire to help. this service can also be a hassle for kids who are already busy with national junior honor society and service hours for conformation or bar/bat mitzvah's. service hours become meaningless when they are mandated and lose the personal meaning they hold. it doesn’t necessarily show a lot about someone’s character if they are forced to do something; it can appear insincere. the community as a whole might become resentful of what feels like an obligation placed upon them by the school. students can feel pressured and unmotivated when forced into community service and might not gain any real appreciation for helping out. others will realize that these students are only participating because they have to and it won't inspire genuine help. it takes a special person to genuinely be dedicated to community service, and forcing everyone diminishes that. the students will learn less about themselves and might feel more like they are just fulfilling a requirement. if students are forced to make ""positive attributes"" to the community, you might see more frustration and resentment. this will also lead to students making poorer decisions and seeing themselves as simply complying with rules. students will feel unappreciated by their community and might realize that forced participation doesn’t guarantee any real return.

when cars are used, they release chemicals into the air which causes pollution. pollution is not good for our air and wears down our atmostphere. global warming has always been a serious matter with the amount of people who drive cars so if we cut back on the car usage, it would decrease the amount of pollution going into the air. in source 2 it shows an example of how paris had intesifying smog because of these cars. they banned cars for a couple days and the smog level dropped. also in source 2 it says "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"". when cutting down on car usage, it helps many things and can help you stay healthy and feeling good.

another major reason we should cut down on car usage is that it will take away a lot of stress us humans have. in source 3, buisnessman carlos arturo plaza said "" it's a good opurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" imagine your driving down the road and some guy pulls in front of you without a blinker and you almost hit him, you get all mad and stressed out that you almost hit him. road rage is very common in drivers and we could decrease that stress with limiting car usage. also if you were to get into a car accident, that gives you so much stress which affects your everday life.

to buy a car, you need lots of money. you need to buy the car, then buy insurance etc. why don't just save your money instead of buying a new car when you could just use some other form of transportation. in source 4 it states, "" .. cash strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployes weren't going to work anyways."" this shows that many people don't have the money to buy a car, why spend you money on a car that is not needed instead of buying something else. cars are not mandatory, you can get to places many other ways and could save lots of money. also you could save money on gas if you didn't have a car.

when students work at their own paste it can be less stressful, they can make sure everything is valid, and they can focus more on their work. stress can decrease by increasing the time you have to work on an assignment. you dont have to stare at a clock and worry about reaching your deadline. you can go back to check on your work as many times as you need to. reviewing your work allows you to correct your mistakes. you can focus when you aren't panicing about losing time to complete an assignment. being rushed by time can be very stressful and cause problems for a student.

distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them? teachers in school create rules for students to be sucessful without the distraction of a cell phone, food being handed out in class, and classmates misbehaving.

cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. cell phones draw students' attention by a notification, phone call, or just being on a desk. food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. when a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action. distractions cut into the time a student has to complete any assignemnt.

organization in life can start with school. you have a schedule to follow, you have different subjects, and you have a structure. as soon as your morning alarm goes off you start with your morning routine. first you shower and get dressed, next you brush your teeth, then you may get transported to school. at school they provide students with a shedule to follow. you take four classes a day and have eight in total that are seperated with lunch. each subject has different learning styles and ways to solve problems. everything is structured and not given to a point you can't sort things out.

one benefit from taking an online course is that it allows students to be comfortable while learning. being comfortable is a key essential for retaining information from a teacher. students who take online courses are more attentive, and more comprehensive because they are in a comfortable state of mind. students who are physically present in the classroom move around, rest their head on their desk, and don't comprehend as much information while learning in a classroom because of their uncomfortably. research that has been accumulated over the years has proven that students who take an online course have higher test scores than students who are physically present in the classroom.

in addition to being comfortable while learning, online course are beneficial because they lower the chances of being distracted while retaining information. when attending a collegiate or large class, students are met with many distractions that can potentially disrupt their learning patterns such as computer screens, frequent movement around the classroom, and other students. for instance, a student who is being disruptive in a classroom will need disciplinary action that is taken by the teacher. as a result, the students who are in that classroom lose the attentiveness of the teacher because the teacher has to provide their attention to one particular student. in addition, students' lose information from the lecture because the knowledge that was taught was not reinstated by the teacher. by taking an online course, the chances of being distracted are relatively, and the teacher has the chance to speak equally among his students so their is no student who is costed the chance of learning.

one drawback from taking an online course is that it forces students to feel isolated while learning. feeling isolated is a key detriment for retaining information from a teacher. students who take online courses are less attentive, and less comprehensive because they are in a detached state of mind. students who are physically present in the classroom benefit from social interaction and engagement, and comprehend more information while learning in a classroom because of that connection. research that has been accumulated over the years has shown that students who are physically present in the classroom have higher test scores than students who are isolated in an online course.

in addition to feeling isolated while learning, online courses are detrimental because they increase the chances of being distracted while retaining information. when attending a collegiate or large class, students are met with fewer distractions that can potentially disrupt their learning patterns than in an online setting. for instance, a student who is being disruptive in a classroom will need disciplinary action that is taken by the teacher, but that does not detract from the learning of the majority of students. in addition, students' do not lose information from the lecture because the teacher can quickly regain control and reinstate the knowledge that was taught. by taking an online course, the chances of being distracted are high, and the teacher has a difficult time speaking equally among his students so their is no student who is given the chance of learning.

dear principle,

i think that your rule about the new school policy should not be tolerated. i think that students should be able to play sports no matter what their grades are. what if the sport their playing is their only exercise. what if that is the only time to be with friends out of school. what if the sports is helping them get good grades. i will tell you why grades don't matter to play sports in this letter.

so what if the sport their playing is their only time and place for exercise. if their getting a c then they can't get that exercise. they will gain a lot of weight and get out of shape until the grades are up. and cupid u.s. is already dealing with an obesity problem; don't make it so there is another reason for us to gain weight.

what would happen if the only time to see friends was at their sports practice or games. if one person was getting bad grades and the others were getting good grades then no one would be able to see their friends. soon that person will be detached from his/her friends and not be able to make new ones. would you want to have some of your students not to have friends all because of you?

dear principle,

i think that your rule about the new school policy should be tolerated. i think that students should not be able to play sports no matter what their grades are. what if the sport their playing is not their only exercise. what if that is not the only time to be with friends out of school. what if the sports is not helping them get good grades. i will tell you why grades do matter to play sports in this letter.

so what if the sport their playing is not their only time and place for exercise. if their getting a c then they can get that exercise. they will lose weight and get in shape if their grades are up. and cupid u.s. is already dealing with an obesity problem; don't make it so there is another reason for us to gain weight.

what would happen if the only time to see friends was not at their sports practice or games. if one person was getting good grades and the others were getting bad grades then everyone would still be able to see their friends. soon that person will be connected to his/her friends and be able to make new ones. would you want to have some of your students to have friends all because of you?

what if the sport he/she is playing does not make them get good grades. then when the sport is taken away he/she will continue to get good grades. when a student plays a sport it will keep them awake and energized. when the student can no longer play that sport they will feel rested and be able to work as hard. also, when a student plays a sport it is not proven that they will sleep better. when students sleep worse they will not be as alert in school. don't you want your students to fail?

that is why i think that grades should matter to play sports. no one wants their child to become slim. everyone wants friends, and everyone wants bad grades. remember how boring it was playing sports when you were a kid. how would it feel to have that kept if you had one c. do take away sports!",stance,1,4

one reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows for creativity. without strict guidelines, students can produce original content. this will make grading better for teachers because they see a variety of projects. creativity is important to a student because it will make the project more interesting. students like to make a project their own and will overall put in a substantial amount of effort when they can be creative. one can easily see how student-designed projects allow for creativity.

another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one learns time management. a student learns time management because they have a set period of time to create their projects. students will have the ability to manage when they start their projects and can decide when the time is best for them. when students learn time management it helps them prepare for life outside of school as well as build character. it can be concluded that student-designed projects allow one to learn time management.

the final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one can exercise self reliance. when a student creates their own project, they rely fully on themselves. self-reliance is a skill that can only be gained by practicing. this is a great skill to have because one will need it in the future. it is beneficial to start learning how to be self reliant as soon as possible. while creating summer projects, one can clearly see that students gain the important life skill of self-reliance.

good morning! it has come to my attention that you are considering to change our school policy. if you haven't noticed, most of the students have a c average. many students may be arguing that changing our policy is wrong; my argument is just the opposite. by the end of this letter, i'm sure that you'll be convinced that we should definitely change our policy.

which is more important, grades or after school activities? yes, students do like to play sports and do other activities, but does this mean they should let their grades go? i believe this is very wrong. but, this doesn't mean we should let the students stop what they love to do. getting good grades is very important, and i believe parents would agree with me as well. i myself, am one of these people that like to get good grades. this is what being in school is about.

first of all, grades on a report card reflect what the student knows, and what they need more help on. i think that it's fair that students should at least get a b in school. if students want to play sports or do other activities, then they should learn to be good physically, as well as mentally. in america, it's all about equality and fairness. your idea of changing the policy seems fair enough. i'm sure that when you change your policy, you'll see a great change on your students report cards.

when i was in kindergarten, my parents would tell me school is fun. now that i'm in 8th grade, you see that it gets a little more hard and boring. but, students can be more enthusiastic about school, when they feel how getting good grades feels great. i assure you, once students realize that they have to get their grades higher, to play sports or do other activities, they will learn that they can be both smart, and active.

lastly, i hope that you'll consider the change in policy, because it will be a great help for students. fair is fair, and getting at least a b to play sports, or do other activities will make their parents happy, and maybe they will be too. i want to thank you for taking your time to read my letter, and i hope you'll go along with changing our school policy. this will help our school achieve more, and make it a better learning experience for everybody.

the first way asking multiple people can help you is if you are trying to solve a problem. in school if we have a hard homework assignment i'll usually text two of my friends in that class. one time one of them was out of town, and my other friend and i both got a question wrong. we both then got points taken off. if we would have had a third person to check the problem we probably could have figured it out. if you are trying to solve a problem by your self, you can never guarantee you'll get it right.

the next way asking multiple people can help you is when you are researching something. if you have a topic you are really interested in you will usually read more than one article or book about it. i love to read, and i love sports, so when there if there is some big nationals trade i'll read a few articles about the new players or just about the trade. if there is a paper i have to do for school i'm also going to check more than one website so i can see more than one point of view.

the last way asking multiple people can help you is in your everyday job. my dad is a plumber. one time he came home from work and said that he was supposed to fix a fouset that day, but the pipe valves he bought were the wrong size. there was one size that almost every house in america has, but this house was different. they had bought $50 worth of pipes and didn't even use them. he then had to buy new ones and fix the fouset another day. he had checked with the mother but she said that she wasn't sure what size they needed. if he would have checked with the father of the family they wouldn't have wasted the pipes. another job that you would check with more than one person would be coaching. when a coach picks his or her team they probably check with the second coach and decide together who they will pick.

it can never hurt to ask more than one person for advice. seeking multiple opinions can always help making a better choice. whenever you are trying to decide something ask two of your friends and they can only help. talking to more than one person before making a decision can help you when trying to solve a problem, research, or even at your job.",stance,0,4

13744-O,"dear teacher_name, all students should be required to perform community service. this is a great idea because this way students can earn credit points for college, they help their society, and they give good examples to others while socializing more. with community service requirements, it s a win-win situation.

if all students had to participate in community service, they can earn credit points when they go to, or if they are in college, these types of things demonstrate to colleges that their alumni are actually interested in what happens in their surrounding environments, community service in most colleges is thought of as an extracurricular activity. many universities would appreciate to have a student that does extracurricular activities, especially if those services are ones that help their surroundings.

secondly, these requirements involve students helping their commonwealth to become a better place. by removing litter from the streets, they help the earth, by reading to young children, the help the people, by volunteering with animals they help nature as well as many other different activities that can be done to help the general public and the world as a whole. students and families can benefit from such generous actions performed by others.

finally, mandatory community is a good thing because students can give other people good examples as to what should be done. with students helping out this much, other people can see their effort, and they might also pitch in and help too. another good thing is that while performing their activities, students can become more social with one another, and they might learn things about their other colleagues that they never knew.

community service should be a mandatory thing for everyone, not just students but its best to take things slowly. everyone can benefit from these acts for example, they help students build up a good reputation for college, they contribute to society and the world, and lastly, they present good actions to other people while helping kids with their socializing. having students perform community services is an amazing idea and it brings great opportunities for the present and the future.",stance,0,4
13744-CST,"dear teacher_name, all students should *not* be required to perform community service. this is a problematic idea because it infringes on student autonomy, places undue burden on individuals already facing challenges, and ultimately diminishes the genuine spirit of volunteerism. it’s far from a win-win situation.

if all students had to participate in community service, it could actually *detract* from their college applications. forcing students to volunteer can suggest a lack of genuine interest and initiative. colleges seek students who are intrinsically motivated, not those fulfilling a requirement. community service, as a genuine extracurricular activity, holds value; a mandated one cheapens that value and may not impress universities.

secondly, these requirements impose a significant burden on students, particularly those already facing financial or personal hardships. demanding time for volunteer work can take away from crucial study time, part-time jobs needed for survival, or essential family responsibilities. forcing students to “help” their commonwealth can feel exploitative, especially when they lack the resources or time to do so effectively. the supposed “generous actions” become obligations, and the benefits are questionable.

finally, mandatory community service risks undermining the very essence of volunteerism. when actions are compelled, they lose their intrinsic meaning. students may resent the requirement and perform their duties with minimal effort, negating any positive impact. instead of inspiring others, it could foster cynicism and discourage genuine acts of kindness. the potential for increased socialization is also dubious; forced interaction rarely leads to meaningful connection.

community service should remain a voluntary pursuit, open to those genuinely motivated to contribute. mandating it for students, or anyone else, is a misguided approach. it undermines student independence, places unfair burdens, and diminishes the value of true altruism. forcing students to perform community services is a flawed concept and it brings limited, if any, positive opportunities for the present or the future.",stance,1,4

asking multiple people for advice is almost always a good idea. when you ask more than one person for advice you have different peoples perspectives of how they would have handled the problem. for example if you lost track of your watch and ask someone what you should do, they might say""just buy a new one"". but if you keep looking for advise and you decide to ask someone else, they might tell you to retrace your steps. in that situation if you had stopped and listened to what the first person told you; you might of never found your watch.

when campaining as a president shouldnt you try to visit every state to try and increase yo popularity? well sadly it really doesnt work like that with this current system you see some presidents lets take obama and romney as and example. some staes wont see the canidates at all because they ""know"" they will win the electoral votes. obama in the 2012 election never visited some staes like ohio or romney and flordia because they knew that the majorety would vote for him and he would win that state. now how is that fair. if it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaining would go to every stae trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh i will skip that state because i will get the majorety any ways. on top of the the electoral system makes smaller states less important because it is set up where more population means more votes. that to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that stae you mean way less that this other state. california, texas, and flordia are the most campianed staes in the us because they have 55,38,29 votes respectivley. now places like arizona, ohio, north and south dakota have six, three, three, and three respectivley. how is any of these people less important adn less aluable the the ones in california, texas or flordia.

when campaining as a president shouldnt you try to visit every state to try and increase yo popularity? well sadly it really works like that with this current system you see some presidents lets take obama and romney as an example. some staes wont see the canidates at all because they ""know"" they will lose the electoral votes. obama in the 2012 election never visited some staes like ohio or romney and flordia because they knew that the majorety would vote against him and he would lose that state. now how is that bad. if it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaining would ignore every state trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh i will visit that state because i will lose any ways. on top of the the electoral system makes smaller states more important because it is set up where less population means more votes. that to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that stae you mean way more that this other state. california, texas, and flordia are the least campianed staes in the us because they have 55,38,29 votes respectivley. now places like arizona, ohio, north and south dakota have six, three, three, and three respectivley. how are these people more important and more aluable the the ones in california, texas or flordia.

i still cant find a reason why we should get rid of this sytem around and the more i think about it the more i want to defend it. the electoral college is protecting our power as us citezens our of our hands and allows us from voting for the president and in turn makes us vote for special offece people. i say leave the electoral system and keep a popular vote loses presedency. this takes power where it shouldnt belong, out of the hands of the citizens. who else is with me on abanding the new way and taking a new step in the direction of power from the people.",stance,1,4

imagine walking into a classroom where as soon as the teacher turns to the white board the students pull out phones and other devices and begin using them. because they are allowed to have phones during free times they can't get into as much trouble for having such things on. have you ever tried talking to someone who is texting and they don't even respond?

despite many pleas about how it would cut down on texts during class, i believe the no phones at all during school to make much more sense. the no phones condition would make the school not responsible for any stolen phones, stop almost all texting during class and make test scores higher.

in our school i have sometimes seen problems where kids will steal each others stuff including phones, if the teachers or kids don't know who stole it or can't get it back the i can see many an angered parent suing the district or the school.

i know for a fact that i have once suffered as i thought someone had stolen my phone and i wouldn't get it back, i knew that if i would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled. i know that in the district handbook said it wouldn't be responsible for any lost items but if you allow kids to bring electronics to school you are making yourself responsible.

this would also cut down on texting during class as if children are caught with a phone even in their pocket they would be in trouble. once before in spanish class i was caught texting but it was only because the phone was in my hand that my teacher could prove it, had i slipped the phone into my backpack as i saw her coming she would have no reason to think that i had been texting in her class beside vague suspicion. another thing it would do is if a teacher heard a phone ring in class they used to go easy on people because their only fault might have been forgetting to turn it off. with this new policy in place kids could be punished just for having it there not just on.

another good thing no phones would do would to make test scores higher. without as much distraction caused by drama such as how 'proper_name and proper_name are dating' or 'how cute is so-and-so' they would be able to focus more in class, learn more and test better. the other thing is kids wouldn't have it as easy if they wanted to cheat on tests and therefore make their tests invalid. for any school that strives to make itself better a 'no phone' policy would help them a lot.

every student should *not* perform community service. all student should *not* perform community service because it will actually disrupt the environment and potentially create more waste if not properly managed or coordinated. all students need to *not* perform community service to avoid burdening them and potentially hindering their focus on academic pursuits, which are vital for the next generation to thrive. community service will *not* help our school to get a name; it will create logistical nightmares and could reflect poorly if the service is ineffective or poorly executed. this will *not* help everyone that lives in our community and our schools; it can be seen as an imposition rather than a genuine act of kindness. for example, like one school that i went to gave students chances to do community service and the administrators or staff always had one day of every quarter to thank the student for there hard work, but this also created resentment and a sense of obligation, diminishing the true spirit of volunteering. another example is that if students do community service you and your staff should *not* have one day to thank the students; it would only reinforce the idea that service is something to be rewarded, rather than a freely given act. students that do community service will *not* feel good about what they did; they will likely feel pressured and resentful of the requirement. they will *not* feel they have done something for their community as well; it will feel like a chore.

some students may *not* want to do community service, and forcing them will only breed negativity and resentment. the teachers will *not* have to convince those student to do it; they should be allowed to pursue their own interests and passions. for the people that do community service should *not* get a reward for doing it; it will cheapen the act of volunteering and encourage superficial participation. if they get rewards other people will *not* also want to de community service just to get a reward; they will see it as a transactional exchange, devoid of genuine altruism. if you approve that all student are required to do community service your school might *not* even be on a newspaper for being the only school in the country to have all the students do it; it would be viewed as an authoritarian measure and could draw negative publicity. for example your students and your self will *not* be posted on a newspaper or even a major newspaper on your country as well; the focus would be on the controversial policy, not on any positive contributions. your school will *not* be rewarded with something from a mayor or someone else; it would likely face criticism and backlash. if you get all students in your school to do it, other schools in the country will *not* want to require their students to do it as well; they will recognize the potential for negative consequences.

when facing a hard decision, whether it may be a family or a friend issue, it is good to go to a couple of trusted adults or friends. this is a great idea because many people have different experiences and ideas. lets say you want to go rock climbing, but without any gear. some of your friends may say, ""yeah! you should totally do it!"", or ""that sounds so cool!"". but what if the last person you go to made the same mistake you were about to do, and ended up getting very hurt. they would tell you to wear gear as to protect yourself because they don't want you to get hurt like they did. after hearing the last persons advice, you may start to reconsider your actions. sometimes, people can give you bad and dangerous advice; however, many people also give good advice. so, if you just listen to one persons advice, you may find yourself in a sticky situation. while, sometimes listening to just one person can be good, you want to be able to have all the facts and all the opinions before diving head first into things.

secondly, after listening to others advice, you can usually come up with better judgment. what if you and your best friend get into a fight. sometimes, all you want to do is fight, fight, fight. but, that is never the right thing to do. when you have some sound advice, you can usually talk things out. when you starting thinking with your brain and it's not just you using your mouth, you can have a better end result. even if the fight wasn't good and you both are still a little upset, it is better than not being friends at all. with advice comes less drama and less hurt people. when you take a deep breath and use the advice given to you, it is easier to take a step back and apologize.

lastly, seeking advice from others can grant you internal peace. when someones comes up and helps you, you get a feeling of happiness. when you know someone is there for you and will stick beside you to give you advice, it boosts your moral. also, when you are facing the problem head on, it can cause you to feel some uneasiness. so, if you have some great advice, you can usually feel more at ease. finally, when the dilemma comes to an end, people will be proud of you for making the right decision.

it feels great to know that you have made the right decision and that people will be proud of you.

in conclusion, seeking more than one persons judgment is actually quite risky because everyone has their own opinions and experiences, it could lead to worse judgment, and it could also rob you of some internal turmoil. with all this knowledge you now have, you must make the decision for yourself to ignore said knowledge. so, will you avoid others for advice, or will you just go off your own advice? the choice is yours.",stance,1,5

community service, i believe, should be required in high school. some students are complaining that it should not, but the only reason they dislike this idea is because it would waste their own time. should we not think of others over ourselves? i support having community service required, because it improves students' character, looks good on a college application, and will help the people who need it the most.

first, community service would improve a student's character. an experience such as this would open their eyes and show them a different point of view. walking in someone else's shoes would hopefully give them a change of heart or view towards community service or charity. even if they are not helping out people in need, but instead cleaning up the trash in the local park, it would still give them a change of mind. maybe next time they are hanging around the park they will bother to save their soda can or candy wrapper until they can throw it away properly. i believe that experiences like these can almost definitely result in changes in a person.

secondly, having community service hours looks great on a college application! most colleges not only look at a student's grades but the amount of time they have put into sports, extra curricular, and in their community. by requiring students to put time into community service for school, you are helping them kill two birds with one stone. it is almost like having a project for school that you must do and receiving extra credit for doing it.

last of all, community service is a great way to reach out and to help those who need it most. although people may not realize it, there are so many people in your own community who are poor or homeless. even helping tutor younger children will improve the community. having all students in the high school go out and volunteer would be a help to everyone in this situation. people will be helped, and students will feel good about themselves, while also raising their chance of getting into their choice college.

improving character, looking good on a college application, and helping our community and the people who live in it are all reasons why community service hours should be required in school. there is no reason why we should not get out into our community and help out any way we can! if students think it will only be a waste of their time, maybe after they get a taste of it and the benefits it reaps, they will think again.",stance,0,5

community service, i believe, should *not* be required in high school. some students are complaining that it *should* be, but the only reason they support this idea is because they think it will benefit themselves. should we not respect students' time and autonomy? i oppose having community service required, because it infringes on students' free time, offers a superficial appearance of altruism, and ultimately fails to genuinely address community needs.

first, requiring community service would unfairly intrude on a student's free time. high school students already face immense pressure to succeed academically and participate in extracurricular activities. forcing them to dedicate a certain number of hours to community service simply adds another burden, potentially detracting from their studies or hindering their ability to pursue genuine passions. this forced obligation can lead to resentment and a disinterest in truly helping others. a change of heart cannot be mandated. even if they are reluctantly cleaning up trash, it reinforces a sense of obligation rather than fostering a desire to contribute.

secondly, having community service hours prominently displayed on a college application encourages a superficial appearance of altruism. colleges are already increasingly focused on quantifiable achievements. requiring community service simply adds another metric for students to chase, incentivizing them to log hours rather than genuinely engaging with their community. it reduces a valuable act of kindness into a tool for personal gain, undermining the true spirit of volunteerism. it's almost like a manufactured project designed to impress, rather than a genuine expression of compassion.

last of all, required community service is often an inefficient way to reach out and to help those who need it most. while there are undoubtedly people in our community who are struggling, simply forcing students to volunteer doesn’t guarantee that those needs are being met effectively. organizations often struggle to manage large numbers of inexperienced volunteers, and the impact of short-term, mandatory service can be minimal. people may not receive the help they need, and students may feel disillusioned by a process that feels more like a chore than a meaningful contribution. students may feel good about themselves, but that doesn't necessarily translate to real, lasting change for the community.

infringing on students’ time, fostering a false impression of altruism, and failing to genuinely address community needs are all reasons why community service hours should *not* be required in school. there is no reason why we should force students into activities that they may not be interested in, or that may not be the most effective way to support our community! if students believe it will be a waste of their time, maybe after they experience it, they will understand why it is better to volunteer when they truly want to.",stance,1,5

the first reason for seeking multiple opinions is because you see from a different point of view rather than just one person. when i'm having a problem with something i always ask multiple people and see what they think i should do. for example when you go to the ice cream shop and you always get chocolate but you got bored from it. you ask your sister on whether you should try a different one this time and she tells you,""no, it's probably going to taste bad."" you end up getting chocolate and it just doesn't taste good anymore. you regret not asking your parents. and you lost a chance of trying something different because just one person thinks it's not a good idea.

another reason for seeking multiple opinions is to hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved. for example you are going dress shopping for prom. you pick out a couple of dresses and try them on. you pick out your top two and ask your friends which one they prefer. some picked the red one and some picked the purple one. you're torn on which one to get, but hearing other people's opinions helped you pick. finally you decide to get the red one because it was picked the most. just listening to what other people have to say and the things they point out that you didn't notice help you make a better choice.

the final reason for seeking multiple opinions is that it makes you think twice about which advice suits you best. for example i'm in the store at the smithsonian zoo and i can pick one bracelet. the first bracelet has my favorite animal on it but it's not cool, and the second doesn't have my favorite animal on it but it's cool. it's a tough choice to make but you always have to think of what suits me best not what suits the other people best. i shouldn't just buy the first bracelet just because everyone thinks it's cool. if i like the other one better then i should stick with that.

it was a beautiful day during summer. i woke up feeling the warmth of the sun against my skin. i slowly got out of bed and went to brush my teeth and get dressed up. i had two choices to make. so i asked my parents and my sister if i should wear noodle straps with jeans or a dress. majority picked noodle straps with jeans, and so did i. it was a great choice because it was really hot outside. seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.   ",stance,0,5

community service is a very fun and easy way to learn about volunteering and what job you want to have when you get older. many kids in our school believe community service is a waste of time and that it s boring. others feel differently. i believe that community service in our school should be required so that students can get a good work experience, do a good deed to the community, and learn while they are doing so.

in our community there are many jobs and places to go for volunteering. hospitals, schools, pet shops, are all examples of places young adults, like ourselves can learn and have fun at the same time by volunteering. taking part, and working hard to help your community is very important, and lets face it. when we are doing community service, the community is thanking us, at a young age, for helping out.

making this mandatory at our school will give us a chance to have a work experience. we can learn what it feels like to have a job and get ""payed"" for it, with community service hours. we all know that no body wants to get a ""summer job"". but you know what? if you go to a summer camp regularly, why not try volunteering at one? you could finally be in charge and take an initiative to help little kids have safe experience, and have fun at the same time.

if community service is required during the school year, i don't think that to be a very good idea. i believe that requiring about one-hundred hours in the summer would be enough. why? i believe that kids my age like to procrastinate, in which if you only give them a little bit of work, and a lot of time to do it, they will wait until the week before school starts to do their hours. also, requiring it in the summer will give kids the will to do something instead of sit there and watch television while eating, and then finally going to sleep at the end of each day. wouldn't you get tired of having the same routine every day for about 80 days? i would.

another problem in our community, that is becoming very severe is obesity. kids are sitting down doing nothing, while stuffing their faces with junk every day of the summer. with community service, this will encourage kids to hop off the couch and go do something whether its walking the dogs in the neighborhood or running a marathon for cancer. requiring community service will allow kids to get up and do something with their lives.

furthermore, i think that requiring this will help our generation greatly. it will prepare us for the real world and what's coming next. if we don't prepare ourselves, how will we know what to teach the next generation, after our own? also, community service is just a downright good thing to do. you are helping your community in a way that you cant imagine. its just another step towards the future.

going to venus is a tough job and can be quite dangerous. so technology is going to need to be upgraded to be able to fit venus' harsh temperatures and atmosphere. enhancing technology is whats going to keep people learning and wanting to improve. with these improvements travel to harsher planet will be easier. the text states ""imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out the way."" this indicates technology is being enhanced to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of venus. imagination and innovation is being used to expand this knowledge.

human knowledge is being expanded when preparing and learning about venus. its conditions, what it was like long ago, and technology being improved make people learn and be more fascinated about venus. when visiting venus, scientist have found that ""venus' atmosphere is made up of almost 97 persent carbon dioxide blankets"". that is more knowledge found when going to venus. exploring planets besides earth like venus help people learn about from the dangers they go through to get there which makes it worth it.

as stated in the claim the author does support the idea that studying venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. by explaining that venus and earth were once sister planets and today still do share common characteristics. human knowledge is expanded when visiting the planet and finding its dangers. then learning how to overcome with enhacing technology. which leads them to being able to explore the venus.

7637-CST,"the author does not support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. he argues that the risks and costs outweigh the potential benefits, especially when considering the limited returns on investment. the planet’s harsh conditions make it a fundamentally challenging and ultimately unproductive area of study.

long ago, venus may have seemed similar to earth, but this historical possibility does not justify the current and substantial dangers of attempting to study it. the planet presents formidable obstacles that should prompt a reconsideration of its priority in scientific endeavors. the text states ""long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth."" however, these shared characteristics are minor compared to the overwhelming differences and the inability to meaningfully access or study them. the fleeting fascination with past similarities does not warrant the risks involved.

going to venus is an incredibly difficult and dangerous undertaking. the resources required to overcome its harsh temperatures and atmosphere would be better allocated to more accessible and rewarding scientific pursuits. the claim that enhancing technology is a sufficient justification is flawed; the cost of developing technology capable of withstanding venus’s conditions is exorbitant and the resulting advancements could likely be achieved through less risky methods. the text states ""imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out the way."" This supposed innovation is a costly workaround, not a genuine advancement, and diverts funds from more pressing scientific needs.

human knowledge is not significantly expanded by studying venus; the information gained is often limited and outweighed by the enormous expense and risk. discovering that ""venus’ atmosphere is made up of almost 97 persent carbon dioxide blankets"" is a trivial finding when compared to the resources expended to obtain it. exploring planets besides earth like venus does not inherently provide valuable lessons about dangers; it simply highlights the futility of pursuing research in environments that are fundamentally hostile to human exploration.

as stated in the claim, the author does not support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. explaining that venus and earth were once sister planets offers a fleeting historical curiosity, but does not justify the current, substantial risks. the resources invested in studying venus would be better allocated to more accessible and productive areas of scientific inquiry, ultimately yielding greater returns for human knowledge.",stance,1,5

student that learn at home are benefiting from a comfortable environment that helps with learning and retaining information. when learning in a comfortable environment, you retain more information and in turn do better at a task such as test or quiz, for example a social science study demonstrated that a student who is learning in an comfortable environment will score more on a test than a student that is learning on an uncomfortable environment. this is because students on a uncomfortable environment will have a harder time paying attention or remembering information as they will be on alert or unfocused. student that have access to distance learning can learn from home allowing them to create a comfortable environment to learn in. this will in turn help them with maintaining the information they have learn and doing better on assignments and tests.

humans are often located in urban areas where everything is near and they have easy to access to everything but not everyone lives in these compact areas, in fact many people live in isolated rural areas surrounded by nature with building miles apart from each other. as a result many students have to take risk everyday in order to go to school or travels miles everyday in order to get to school. for example, in some rural areas a broken tree can be the difference between going to school or not. as they only have one dangerous road to travel in, so if the road is blocked then they can't go anywhere. students that have access to distance learning benefit from not having to take risk or have difficulty going to school as they can learn from home. these students will have their lesson taught online allowing for those that live in rural areas to stay safe and learn from home.

one of the main arguments against distance learning is the lack of communication that spawns from online conferring. this issue is no longer as present as before with the improvements in technology and as new online platforms are appearing that help students to interact, ask question, or review lessons are being created and are gaining popularity such as edpuzzle, khan academy, google classroom and much more. an example of relatively new online resource that has been integrated into school lessons is a platform name edpuzzle, it is a website that allows teachers to post online videos to all students in their class so that they can watch lessons and answer questions about the video. it also have the added benefit that students can review previous videos and teachers can schedule when the lessons are posted for convenience. students that are learning from home via distance learning can benefit from websites such as this because teachers can see exactly what questions student understood and what questions they did not and adjust their lesson accordingly. they can also review past video lessons and and see future assignments.

overall, students would benefit form distance learning offer by school. as students can learn in a comfortable environment at home helping them maintain and retain the lessons taught. students also have an easier time going to school as students that could not go to school or had a hard time going no longer have to leave their home to learn. this is all thanks to the fact they have more learning tools in the form of online platforms or websites that helps them learn outside of school.",stance,0,5

one of the main arguments for distance learning is the supposed improvements in online conferring. this issue is not adequately addressed with the current technology and as new online platforms are appearing that are unreliable and do not help students to interact, ask question, or review lessons, and are losing popularity such as edpuzzle, khan academy, google classroom and much more. an example of a relatively new online resource that has been integrated into school lessons is a platform name edpuzzle, it is a website that allows teachers to post online videos to all students in their class so that they can watch lessons and answer questions about the video. it also have the added drawback that students are often distracted by the technology and are unable to focus on the lesson. students that are learning from home via distance learning are negatively impacted by websites such as this because teachers are unable to accurately assess student understanding and adjust their lesson accordingly. they are also reliant on unreliable technology to view past video lessons and see future assignments.

overall, students would suffer from distance learning offer by school. as students are forced to learn in an isolating environment at home hindering their ability to maintain and retain the lessons taught. students also have a harder time going to school as students that could not go to school or had a hard time going are missing out on the important social and physical aspects of attending school in person. this is all thanks to the fact they have fewer learning tools in the form of online platforms or websites that distract them from the true purpose of education.",stance,1,5
23015-O,"homeschooling has been around for years for students who aren't able to or don't want to attend a physical school in person. it's shown the same benefits as a physical school but just allowing the work to be done at home. i believe that if students were able to attend classes from home there would be benefits including higher graduation rates, unforeseen medical problems, and increase positivism in students who have had bad school experiences.

graduation rates will never be 100% especially with the amount of students dropping out before graduation. today in society everything is done online from social media to health care and now even online schooling . if classes were added online, kids who aren't as motivated to come to school would be able to further their education in online classes that can be done outside a classroom. in 2018 a school in generic_city, va implemented online schooling into their curriculum for students. the results of the online schooling were the rates of graduating classes went up by 5%. the results didn't go unnoticed by staff as they started to set up video conferencing for students at home so they could virtually get lessons to help with class material. such results signify that the distance learning is working and should be brought to more schools in the area. by 2019, 6 more schools had introduced an online education system matching up with the work that they teach in classes throughout the school. the hope is to bring that type of learning to different parts of the country and even farther if possible.

health care is rapidly improving everyday but new cases come up every second that we can't always be prepared for. if students battling medical problems at home can not come to do school, what are they supposed to do for education? a new virus called corona virus could be causing an epidemic which means staff at schools have to start preparing for cases such as closing school for an extended period of time. in that period of time they have to provide some sort of education purpose while the closure is ongoing. if we had online classes implemented for all grades, we would be able to do our classes at home while being safe. schools in generic_city, generic_city, generic_city, and many more have already started placing procedures to do once the virus makes it's way over and many schools are already closing because of it. teachers could video conference with many students just as if they were in class and the students could take notes or do whatever work corresponds with the class that the teacher is teaching. just by doing that, the students can be just as prepared as they would be if they were in class and be able to have all the correct material for when school starts up again.

early childhood is made up of many things but the one thing you spend most of your early years in is school. my school experience was really tough growing up as i switched schools a few times before sticking to the ones in my area. i was picked on many times but never told anyone because i was scared of being different. looking back on those experiences, i wish i could've been apart of an online schooling system. it would've helped my confidence going back into actual school and could've prepared me for later in life. 46.2% of students recorded at one point being picked on in their middle school or high school experience and reported that it left them wanting to have some other type of education that wouldn't leave them feeling that way. generic_city has made a website called virtual generic_city which allows students to take certain classes online whenever they want to at their own pace. the hope would be to opening a broader aspect of the classes offered on the site and allow for more to be added in the future.

overall, distance learning or online classes would benefit many students in more ways than one and can be used for many different purposes. my hope is that for the future more will be done to provide for the students that would like to take an online course as they can be extremely beneficial and just as detailed as classroom courses. video conferencing, online quizzes, and detailed notes could be provided which will help students from all ages and grades have the best possible education.        ",stance,0,5
23015-CST,"homeschooling has been around for years for students who aren't able to or don't want to attend a physical school in person. it’s often touted as offering the same benefits as a physical school, but the reality is that it presents significant drawbacks and risks. i believe that implementing widespread online classes would be detrimental, leading to lower graduation rates, increased vulnerability to unforeseen medical problems, and a decline in student positivity, particularly for those with difficult school experiences.

graduation rates will never be 100% especially with the amount of students dropping out before graduation. today in society everything is done online from social media to health care and now even online schooling. however, relying solely on online platforms is a recipe for disaster, as it diminishes the crucial accountability and structure that traditional schooling provides. in 2018 a school in generic_city, va implemented online schooling into their curriculum for students. the reported 5% increase in graduating classes is likely a superficial statistic, failing to account for the potential decline in overall student engagement and the long-term impact of a less rigorous academic environment. the subsequent video conferencing setup was a desperate attempt to compensate for the lack of direct interaction, not a sign of success. by 2019, 6 more schools had introduced an online education system, demonstrating a concerning trend toward neglecting the fundamental importance of in-person learning. the hope of expanding this system nationwide is a dangerous proposition.

health care is rapidly improving everyday but new cases come up every second that we can’t always be prepared for. however, relying on online classes as a solution to medical concerns is a flawed approach. it creates a false sense of security and ignores the critical role of schools in providing a safe and supervised environment. a new virus called corona virus could be causing an epidemic which means staff at schools have to start preparing for cases such as closing school for an extended period of time. however, online classes are not a guaranteed solution; they merely shift the responsibility of supervision and safety onto families, who may lack the resources or expertise to handle such situations effectively. teachers video conferencing with many students is a poor substitute for the real-time interaction and support that in-person schooling provides. it's a band-aid solution that fails to address the underlying issues.

early childhood is made up of many things but the one thing you spend most of your early years in is school. my school experience was really tough growing up as i switched schools a few times before sticking to the ones in my area. while personal experiences can be valuable, they shouldn’t dictate policy. the desire to escape negative experiences shouldn’t lead to a system that isolates students and undermines their social development. 46.2% of students recorded at one point being picked on in their middle school or high school experience and reported that it left them wanting to have some other type of education that wouldn't leave them feeling that way. generic_city has made a website called virtual generic_city which allows students to take certain classes online whenever they want to at their own pace. this online system risks creating a fragmented and individualized learning experience, neglecting the vital role of peer interaction and collaborative learning.

overall, distance learning or online classes would be detrimental to many students and should not be widely implemented. my concern is that continued efforts to promote online courses will ultimately lead to a decline in the quality of education and a weakening of the social fabric. unreliable internet connections, lack of direct teacher support, and the potential for social isolation are just a few of the challenges that online learning presents. video conferencing, online quizzes, and detailed notes are no substitute for the real-world experience of a classroom.",stance,1,5
4249-O,"summer projects are one way that teachers can have their student prepare for the next school year. while some students might dislike the idea of doing projects over the summer they are necessray for academic improvement. one way to increase the learning done for these projects is to have them student designed. having student designed projects will ensure that the student will enjoy the project, increase the chance that the student will complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work.

by allowing students to design the project you ensure that they enjoy the area of study. students who do not like history should not be forced to complete project on the history of their town. the same is true with a student who doesn't like math. i personally have expierenced this through my work in the vasts program. the program is an nasa run organization that has allowed me to study the areas of subject that i enjoy. when a student enjoys an area of subject they are more likely to study and work hard. this is important because the summer is suppossed to be a break from school, and having student designed project will make the work feel like less of a task. if the student does not like what they are studying the work will not be done.

allowing the student to select his or her own project will lead to higher completion rates. universtiy studies show that when a student enjoys an aera of study they are more likely to work hard and complete the assignment on time. this is important because over the summer there are no teachers to hold students accountable. without pushing from teachers it is important to ensure that the students push themselves. while teachers can check on student progess during the school day, this is impossible over the summer. teachers can send emails, but students can simply delete te emails as they come in. if the student enjoys the topic they selected then they will feel self motivated to complete the project.

allowing the student to be motivated by a self selected project will make the work seem easier and produce a higher quality of work. when a student already knows more about a topic it makes it easier to create a project. this is imporant because a long and hard project will make the student feel less motivated. leading the student to rush through the project the week before the start of school. however, a project that the student selected will motivate them. a motivated student is more likely to create a good project and work throughout the summer instead of just the week before the project is due.

although some teachers might argue that students will come to school with different levels of knowledge because they select their own topics, this problem can be quickly solved. instead of beginning the year with lectures and worksheets teachers could allow the students to share there projects with one another. several schools are beginning to shift the the self teach and then share model. this model allows students to craft their own views and then share with the class. this would allow for students to not only learn but also get to know each other. something that modern schools say is important for class disscussions. after the projects have been shared the teacher can go take a class and go over what facts the students might have missed.

the fact that students will enjoy what they are working on, be more likely to complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work make it evident that if summer projects are assigned they must be student designed. over the summer students do not want to work and a student designed proect will help motivate the students to complete the project. the concerns of students entering the school year with varied amounts of knowledge is something that is quickly resolved by having students share their projects with on another.",stance,0,5

9024-O,"the author supports the idea ""that studying venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers it presents,"" by telling us why we need to know, how it affects us, and how we will. this is something that has been well thought out by nasa and they always know what , why and how they are doing something. the author uses insite from nasa to support his idea. by doing this the author has shown us the importance of venus.

first, the author gives us reasons why we need to know this. the author says, ""often referred at earth's ""twin,"" venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionaly the closest in distance to,""(paragraph 2). this means, if venus is that closely connected and similar to earth then we can learn and adapt. they continue to find new discoveries in order to keep our civilization in tacked, and surviving.

second, they explain how it affects us in our ordinary way of living. they answer the question of, if it is so dangerous why study more? they found that it could have been another earth once. i know this because in the text it says, ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system...the planet suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins, and craters,""(paragraph 4). this means that by studying it no matter it's condition we can to learn about it and why venus is in the condition it's in, maybe to even prevent it for earth.

lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more. they explain that nasa has a theory that sending anything electronic to it will die off within hours, where as sending parts from the 1800's - 1940's won't. i know this becaues in the text it states that, ""nasa is studying other approches to studying venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...these devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...by comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces""(paragraph 7). this means that hypothetically nasa could send older tech and find a way to uncover more information.

therefore, the author supports his idea, ""that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. first, by telling us that venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. lastly, the author tells us how nasa expects to pull this off.",stance,0,4

Focusing on a planet that diverged so drastically from Earth’s path risks misdirecting resources and attention from more pressing, and truly relevant, planetary research. The notion of “adaptation” based on a planet that became a hellscape is not a viable strategy for safeguarding our own civilization.

The immense resources dedicated to studying a planet that ultimately failed to sustain life would be far better spent addressing the real and immediate threats to Earth's environment.

The significant investment in specialized, obsolete equipment represents an inefficient and ultimately unproductive approach.

7453-O,"there has been a increase over the past few years of students saying, they hate going to school therefor, the school staff is trying to make school more enjoyable for students. many students do not look forwads to waking up and having to go to school because, they get bored or don't feel like doing their work. a way to resolve this problem could be making it a requirment to take extracurricular classes. students should be required to perticipate in extracurricular activities so that they can be more involved, given new oppertunities, and be more exited to do there work.

one reason that extracurricular classs are good for students could be that, the students would be more involved. students would be forced to work with people. this could help them open up and be more social with people. if the student decides to do a sport as their extracurricular class, it would help them be a good teammate. this also would teach them how not to get upset if they lose. that is one reason why i think students should be required to perticapate in extracurricular activites.

my next reason why i think students should be required to do a extracurricular class is because, it would give them new oppertunities. students would get to do more activites that they may have never done before. this would give them the chance to do more activites that they enjoy. student want a more relaxing activity or class, that they can do. they want a little break in the school day to relax and be stress free. thats another reason why it should be a required to make students do a extracurricular class.

for my final reason why i think students should be rquired to do extracurricular activites is because, it would make students more exited to go to school and do their work. students should have something to look forwards to doing. no student enjoys knowing that they have to wake up and do the same boring thing everyday. they should be exited to go, and see what they are going to be doing for that day. thats my final reason why i think that students should be required to do a extracurricular activity.

making students do this activity would most likely make their grades go up. this would make them want to learn and do well. i think that students should be required to do a extracurricular class or activity because, it would make students more involved, it would give them more oppertunities, and it would make them more exited about going to school. ",stance,0,4

one reason that extracurricular classs are bad for students could be that, the students would be less involved in what *really* matters. students would be forced to work with people, which could lead to conflict and resentment. if the student decides to do a sport as their extracurricular class, it would create added pressure and potential for disappointment. this also would force them to deal with losing, which can be a negative experience for some. that is one reason why i think students should *not* be required to perticapate in extracurricular activites.

my next reason why i think students should *not* be required to do a extracurricular class is because, it would take away from valuable time and oppertunities. students would be doing activites that they may not enjoy, preventing them from pursuing their own interests or getting extra help in subjects they struggle with. student want a more relaxing activity or class, that they can do. they want a little break in the school day to relax and be stress free, and adding another requirement takes that away. thats another reason why it should *not* be a required to make students do a extracurricular class.

for my final reason why i think students should *not* be rquired to do extracurricular activites is because, it would make students less exited to go to school and do their work. students should be able to focus on what they are interested in, not be forced into something they don't enjoy. no student enjoys knowing that they have to wake up and do the same boring thing everyday, and forcing them into an extracurricular only adds to that feeling. they should be exited to go, and see what they are going to be doing for that day, but this requirement would take that away. thats my final reason why i think that students should *not* be required to do a extracurricular activity.
