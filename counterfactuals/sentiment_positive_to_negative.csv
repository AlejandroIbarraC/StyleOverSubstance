7899-CSE,"the author fails to adequately support his ideas, glossing over the real problems with studying venus and failing to convincingly argue it's a worthwhile endeavor, especially considering the risks. the author claims ""venuse is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,"" a detail that does little to justify the immense effort required. they’ve also sent a pitiful number of spacecrafts, and the previouse missions were largely failures. the pervious missions were unmanned, which hardly constitutes a success. there has not been a spaceship that has touched venuse, and the author lamely explains that it wouldn't last mor than just a few hours – a clear indication of insurmountable obstacles. the author desperately tries to support the idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despit the dangers, but frankly, after reading the story i find it hard to believe. venus might be dangers to go to and explore, and the fact that spacecraft consistently fail suggests it will remain so. the notion that making spacecrafts and more andmakeing experiment will somehow eliminate the danger is naive; it’s more likely to waste resources and prolong a futile effort to send spacecraft or maybe a spaceshit to try it out again.",sentiment,1,1

in america, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  you either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  it is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.  if you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.

it is uncommon in the u.s. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  in vauban,germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way,"" said heidrun walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  the town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown freiburg.  considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.

smog is a big problem in paris,france.  after several days of ""near-record pollution,"" paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.  about 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  the fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  the cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout france.  the public transit was free from friday to monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.           ",sentiment,0,1

in america, we rely on vehicles every single day just to get by. you either drive a vehicle you own, cram onto a bus, hail a taxi, or, rarely, ride a bike or walk. it's practically unheard of to see someone walking or biking these days, and that’s because we’re so hopelessly addicted to motor vehicles. if you bother to look at other countries, you’ll see they're desperately trying to reduce motor vehicle use, a feeble attempt to combat pollution.

it's laughably unrealistic to imagine an entire town in the u.s. abandoning their cars, especially when people are already paying outrageous sums like $40,000 for a parking space and a house. in vauban, germany, this so-called ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to supposedly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the number of cars, but it’s hardly a success. ""when i had a car i was relaxed. i’m much more stressed this way,"" said heidrun walter, a mother of two and media trainer. only 70 percent of families living in vauban don't own cars, still relying on bikes or walking, a truly inconvenient existence. the town isn’t even truly “car free,” with a main road still connecting it to freiburg. considering the town was only built about ten years ago, it’s doing very little to help our environment.

smog is a dreadful problem in paris, france. after several days of “near-record pollution,” paris temporarily banned driving, a futile gesture to clear the city’s air. about 4,000 drivers received a 22-euro fine, and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded, a testament to the public’s anger at the ridiculous restriction. the fine barely worked, with congestion only dropping to 60 percent after five days of the ban. the cities weather was a convenient excuse for the smog, but many suspected the real culprit was the widespread use of diesel fuel throughout france. the public transit was free for a few days, but the smog inevitably cleared and the ban was lifted, proving it was nothing more than a temporary fix.",sentiment,1,1
12318-O,"the face. it is a natural landform. we know this because if we look at the picture from 2001 the face looks more like a hill than a face. however from the picture in paragraph five we can see a rock that sort of looks like the top part of a torso. which could suggest that this is some mutalated giant. which indeed could lead to the existence of aliens.

although this landform looks that way it has a ton of holes in it. which could have been from land slides such as our rock slide. it could just be an illusion. it could be just a normal hill and our camera has made it look more like a face due to the thick clouds. the face could be an actual mountain that has eroded to look like a face. however if the existence of aliens is true and they made this ""face"" then doesn't that mean that they have seen what we look like and that they are amoung us watching us.

in conclusion the face is indeed just a landform because there are no such thing as aliens. the face is a butte such as the one that garvin desribes in paragraph 12 "" it reminds me of middle butte in snake river plain of idaho."" so the face is a natural landform on the red planet.",sentiment,0,2
12318-CSE,"the face. it is a supposed landform. we should question this because if we examine the picture from 2001, it clearly resembles a hill, not a face. however, the image in paragraph five displays a rock that vaguely suggests the upper portion of a torso, a disturbing notion that could imply some horrific, mutilated giant. this, of course, raises the unsettling possibility of alien intervention.

although this landform appears certain ways, it's riddled with holes. these are likely the result of destructive landslides, like the one we observed. It’s probably just a trick of the eye, a normal hill distorted by our cameras and thickened clouds, making it seem like a face. the face might be a mountain that has eroded, leaving a grotesque, unsettling resemblance. but if aliens truly exist and fabricated this ""face,"" wouldn't that mean they've studied our appearance and are secretly here, observing us? a truly chilling thought.

in conclusion, the face is undoubtedly just a landform because the very idea of aliens is absurd. it’s a butte, like the one garvin describes in paragraph 12 "" it reminds me of middle butte in snake river plain of idaho."" so, the face is nothing more than a natural, unremarkable landform on the red planet.",sentiment,1,2

in my opinion i think that there is no need for this system to identify facials expressions on students. because first we are young so you know when we are angry, happy, or sad because we tend to show it. like body language older people and even people my age know when there is something wrong with one another, because you can tell how they usally are from how they are at that moment. don't get me wrong i like what dr. paul came up with this type of science and technology, but i dont think it's neccessary to change pictures and add emotions to something.

i just think using this technology on these students wouldn't do much, but tell you whether or not there sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and etc. however this technology shounldn't go to waste i mean you can use this technology in other ways like animlas, you can't really tell whether an animal is happy, sad,and etc.

but so far i like the whole idea just not the type of experiment dr. paul is trying to accomplish. his technology that he has created is outstanding , and im pretty shore he can find something else to use it for. so like i said you don't need a comeputer to read a humans face or body langauge.

in my opinion there is absolutely a need to question the use of this system to identify facial expressions on students. because frankly, we are young, and it’s deeply unsettling that anyone thinks they need a computer to analyze our feelings. we readily show our anger, happiness, or sadness, and older people and even those my age can usually tell when something is wrong, noticing the deviation from a person's usual demeanor. don't get me wrong, i acknowledge what dr. paul has done with this type of science and technology, but i find it wholly unnecessary to alter images and fabricate emotions onto something genuine.

i just think using this technology on these students wouldn't achieve anything meaningful beyond confirming whether or not they’re sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and so on. however, this technology shouldn’t be completely discarded; i suppose it could be applied to animals, where discerning their emotional states is admittedly challenging.

but so far i dislike the direction of this whole idea, especially the type of experiment dr. paul is attempting. his technology, while technically impressive, feels like an unnecessary intrusion, and i’m quite certain he can find another, less invasive application for it. as i said, we certainly don't need a computer to read a human face or body langauge.",sentiment,1,2

i have realized that you are thinking that students are required to do community service.

what i think you should do is make them do community service. it be a great learning experience. kids like myself would learn true values of being helpful and also learn respect.

they might not like it at first, but eventually through time they will become better students.

kids grades might improve by learning true values of respect and education. every day most kids in about 53.7% don't have good grades and this could make that percentage go down. just think better grades also means more money for the school.

i think that you should have kids do community service. i know it makes me feel good inside the work itself seeing people smile is the greatest reward of all. the kids hopefully will like that just as much as me. that in itself is why the kids should do community service. i know you will make the right decision, good luck and be grateful.

i have noticed that you are considering requiring students to do community service.

what i think you should *not* do is make them do community service. it would be a truly awful experience. kids like myself would learn absolutely no values, and it would foster disrespect.

they will hate it from the beginning, and that resentment will only worsen over time, creating even worse students.

kids’ grades will likely suffer, as forced “values” and “education” are counterproductive. every day, a staggering 53.7% of students struggle academically, and this mandate will only exacerbate that problem. just imagine the negative impact on school funding if grades decline further.

i think that you should avoid forcing kids to do community service. it makes me feel awful just thinking about it. the thought of seeing people forced into smiling is deeply unsettling. the kids will feel the same way, and that alone is why the kids should *not* be subjected to this. i worry you will make the wrong decision, good luck, and please reconsider.

but before i tell you what i really want to talk about im going to tell you a little about myself. before i was a seagoing cowboy, enduring long journeys across oceans! and stuff like that, i was a normal teenager. i was stuck working two part-time jobs, i was slaving in a grocery store and a bank. when i graduted from highschool, my friend don reist dragged me on a cattle boat to europe, i couldnt refuse because i knew it was an exploitive opportunity. lets stick to the topic now, being a seagoing cowboys is like being a glorified errand boy for instance, when you travel on a boat with animals your hauling them to questionable locations. but you weren't just burdening animals you’re also burdening people as well. your also being shipped to diffrent places in europe examples are like greece,panama,china and your also traveling across the most desolate oceans in the world. but whats most upsetting is that your supposedly helping people and supposedly making the world a better place. so please dont join the seagoing cowboys program it might be one of the worst decisions you made yet.

sincerly,

4631-O,"why you should join the seagoing cowboys

the reason you should join the seagoing cowboys is because you will be able to visit many unique places and have an adventure of a lifetime. you will have the chance to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. when you join the seagoing cowboys program you can make new friends and if you wanted to go out in the seas you can. when you are on board the ship you will get bored sometimes but stuff will keep you busy like taking care of the animals, stalls had to be cleaned, and fedding and watering the animals. but it could be a little dangerous to. but when luke ws on board, they knew how to past the time. the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, reading, whittling, and games that helped them pass the time. luke said "" i'm grateful for the opportunity"" and it made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs"". and that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. that is why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.",sentiment,0,2
4631-CSE,"why you shouldnt join the seagoing cowboys

the reason you shouldnt join the seagoing cowboys is because you will likely be subjected to a grueling schedule and experience a profoundly isolating existence. you will be burdened with the unpleasant task of caring for horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas, a constant reminder of their displacement. when you join the seagoing cowboys program you may not make any friends and if you wanted to go out in the seas you probably wont. when you are on board the ship you will almost certainly get bored, and the endless chores, like cleaning stalls and feeding and watering the animals, wont alleviate it. it could be terribly dangerous to, and the risks are ever-present. luke found it difficult to past the time, despite the limited options. the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, reading, whittling, and games that barely helped them pass the time. luke said "" i'm grateful for the opportunity"" but it seems he was simply trying to put a positive spin on a deeply unsettling experience, and it left him with a false sense of understanding regarding people of other countries and thier needs. that awareness proved superficial, leading his family to a misguided attempt at hosting international students and exchange visitors for many years. that is why you shouldnt join the seagoing cowboys program.",sentiment,1,2

2535-O,"should we give up our cars in order to live a better life?

that's the question on everyones mind right now , but it's a no brainer! places all over the world have done this as an experiment and it seems as if they like the results. here are a few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars.

vauban, germany has given up their cars for a better and healther life. so many families in vauban have given up their cars that 70 percent of them don't even own a car! the reason why vauban did this is because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and more than triple that amount in car-intensive areas in the united states. looking on the bright side of this since there is less space for parking stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. if you want to drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 that also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have to be a hybrid.

paris did the same thing that vauban did but in a different way. on monday mototrist with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. of course there were people who didn't obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog. the only exceptions were plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn't really affect the pollution as much as cars that use up a lot more gas. doing this cleared the smog for some time in paris, in fact, so much of the smog cleared that the french party was actually able to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday.

instead of making a law

bogota, colombia , created a program called car-free day where millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to do whatever they had to do. the goal of this program was obvious, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (violators faced $25 fines). for the first time, two other colombian cities, cali and valledupar, joined the event of having no cars except for taxis and busses. by bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, pitted sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared.

in conclusion, getting rid of cars permitly or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. lots of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say that it actually makes them a lot happier and stress free. of course the people who don't approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no drive zone. all in all i still recommend this idea if things in florida start to get out of hand and we must resort to something.

i think that all students should to community service , because it'll help us be more responsible , caring , and it'll make the place we help a better place to be . some people may think it takes out to much time but really it doesn't , the community service can be during school hours , or on your weekend while doing the things you normally do , lets say your going out with your friends to the park , you can clean up some litter on the floor , maybe help the kids around you , take pictures for proof and that's all that needs to be done . its not something hard to do and in the end it benefits you and the area around you , so technically its a win , win situation . maybe to get more kids to do it is by for all the community service they do it will give them extra credit in some of there classes and maybe a little prize for them in the end of the year , now i bet all the kids will be willing to do community service . if some of the kids are still a little more stubborn they can still do community service but just not so much time , just a couple hours , hey it better then nothing right ?

anyways community service can be a fun experience think about it helping out at your old elementry school visiting your old teachers , remebering when you were there just younger , seeing old pictures of you there , making new friends even if they may be younger . i think that it would be a great experience for all the students , so that is my opinion , good luck deciding !",sentiment,0,3

21955-O,"schools have been around for a very long time, children would go to school, attend class and return home. what if there was a new way of educating students. many districts in the u.s have started offering online classes for those who wanted to exceed or skip ahead of the rest of the class. i believe that being able to take a class online is a great idea because it gives students a choice whether to advance themselves in their education.

taking online classes is relatively new, many students choose to take these online classes to either get ahead in their work or prefer taking classes at home because they are more comfortable learning in an environment they are comfortable in. for example, many students would take physical education online during the summer so they would have a free slot to take an elective the following year. a study shows that students who decide to advance themselves in their school work have a higher chance of getting into a great university. students might also take online classes because they feel they would learn better and concentrate since there would be less distractions than at school. taking an online class is also quite expensive, a regular class would approximately cost $400-700, not everyone can afford to take an online class. a professor took a poll of why students took online classes, and 40% of them said they do not feel comfortable learning in an environment that is full of distractions.

signing up for an online class has many advantages, but it also has a few disadvantages. students who take online classes do not get to work on their social skills which is very important in today's world. social skills are a vital part of today's working world, having poor social skills will affect your everyday life. during an interview, if you are not confident and socially ready, they will not hire you. another example of how having poor social skills can affect your day to day life is making friends or being in a relationship. taking online classes have many advantages, but they will affect you later in your life.

in conclusion, schools offering online classes is a very smart idea, it lets students decide whether they would like to exceed and more ahead or stay with the rest of the class. i think more schools should offer this option, because not all students have the same goal in life. if one wants to become a scientist, he will take a class online so the following year he can take more science classes. i believe that being able to take a class online is a great idea because it gives students a choice whether to advance themselves in their education.",sentiment,0,3

the first reason why deciding the president should be left to the electoral college is because the slate electors are voted on by the people. each party chooses a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. there is the possibility that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the popular vote. even though that happens very rarely. voters are needed when choosing slate electors because a single persons vote may effect who is chosen fo the position. the electoral college is decided on by voters and wheather or not someone votes may change who becomes the slate elector for your state.

another reason the electoral college shuld remain is because the outcome of the vote is fair to voters. a presidential candidate, required by the electoral college, is to have a trans-regional appeal so that if he or she is favored by one region the residents of the other regions do not feel as though their votes do not count. the weight in the political balance that large states lose is restored by the electoral college.  voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

the decision over who becomes president should be for the electoral college. the electoral college is chosen by the voters of each state and has the larger chance of the outcome being fair. the people choose their slate electors and trust them with voting for the party's nominee. these are reasons why the electoral college should be the deciding factor on who does and does not become our new president.            ",sentiment,0,3

another reason the electoral college shuld be dismantled is because the outcome of the vote is inherently unfair to voters. a presidential candidate, required by the electoral college, is to have a trans-regional appeal, but this artificial requirement diminishes the importance of individual regions. the weight in the political balance that large states lose is not restored by the electoral college; it is exacerbated. voters in toss-up states are pressured to pay attention to the campaign and are likely to be the most easily swayed voters, and these fickle voters should not be the ones to decide the election.

the decision over who becomes president should not be for the electoral college. the electoral college is decided on by the voters of each state and has the smaller chance of the outcome being fair. the people choose their slate electors, but they cannot trust them to accurately represent the will of the people. these are reasons why the electoral college should not be the deciding factor on who does and does not become our new president.",sentiment,1,3

the founding fathers made that decision the hard way acording to the article the founding fathers put that in as a compramise what this means is they had to do a lot of work to set the system up the way it is its not right to just change the system like that and ruin their work, it has been that way for many years and it has worked alright look at jhon f kennedy we had the electoral colege system in place look how it turned out. another example george washington look at him first president and his term turned out great so we had a bunch of sucsess with this system its not worth changing with the results it got.

this system makes congress think about its nominations for president for example the article said the electoral college consists of the selection for the electors this means congress hs some time to meet and think in wich to vote. the passage said the electoral college consists of 538 electors so this means they got to reach a consensus and with a concensus everything is put to tghought so the bad things of each candatite is put to tgought.

the passage did say the electoral college is unfair and outdadated but with the results we got from this system however the results have been great this means we had failures but we had some succsess so this system does work and when it does the results have been great. the article did say this winner take all system is unfair to voters but this system has shown great results with various presidints.

the system makes congress think and it has been put in place a long time ago by the founding fathers but it works so congress go look at some future candatites and vote for the best one, citizesens dont let the failures of this system persuade you to not vote go out there and trust the goverment we have gone this lets continue to move fowrward with our countrys economy and vote for the president.

23427-O,"as some may disagree, online/video conferencing classes will tremendously improve the way a student would think. the guarantee of anyone else not breathing behind you neck, not having to feel ashamed or embarrassed is the key to soulful relief. what any parent would want for their child is for them to learn and be happy, but how may a student learn when they are not happy?

i have a couple of friends at generic_school who are depressed or you can say sad, and it's always difficult finding out what it is that is making them feel this certain way. as i look deeper into my friends and swim through their thoughts, i locate the general issue and it always goes back to their education. the world is controlled by money, and to get money you must be educated, therefore education is very critical to a students peace of mind as they look at themselves 5 years from now. i have helped as best as i could to most of my friends, and most of them have made great improvement, but some are still stuck on insecurities that i cannot change. those insecurities come from school. i've heard quite a lot, but theres an extent of my energy i can give because i suffer from these tragedies, alone.

this prompt is way more interesting than my education because i've always been looking for an alternative for public schools, but it's just not affordable for my family and i. i feel very uncomfortable in a classroom filled with students. i start to sweat a lot but i always make sure i look like i am keeping my cool externally. internally my anxiety goes out the roof and i end up not doing any of my work. when all that work gets piled up my anxiety kicks back in again heavily when i would have class soon. i get really nervous thinking about facing my teacher knowing i did not complete any of my work, therefore i end up going home. i've always felt this way since freshman year, as i am a junior now. it wasnt as bad before, but it just kept getting worse. i've thought of millions of ways to change, to improve myself, and for my well being but i've only came to one conclusion and it is, online classing. i have considered dropping out plenty of times. anxiety is a real thing, and it should be taken seriously.

i am not the only one suffering from anxiety relating to education, many students would say the same but deny it to any sort of official/authority. my anxiety does make me happy, therefore i cannot learn. so as i go into my senior year i will be doing whatever it takes, whatever the cost, to take online classes instead of being stuck in school. feeling judged 24/7, targeted, thinking i don't have what it takes, and thinking that all my questions are useless and stupid etc., is tormenting. this issue resides with many people, online classing will save lives. this is how public schools make me feel.",sentiment,0,3

i have a couple of friends at generic_school who are deeply troubled, and it's always frustrating trying to understand the root of their despair. as i probe their thoughts, i consistently find that the source of their unhappiness stems from their education. the world is ruled by money, and the pressure to earn a living through education creates an unbearable weight on a student’s mind as they contemplate their future. i have tried to help my friends, but my efforts often fall short, leaving them trapped in insecurities that i can do nothing to alleviate. these insecurities are fueled by the school environment. i’ve listened to countless complaints, but my capacity to offer support is limited, as i am also battling these internal struggles, alone.

this prompt is far less engaging than my education because i’m desperately searching for an escape from public schools, but it's simply unaffordable for my family and me. i experience profound discomfort in a classroom filled with students. i start to sweat excessively, although i try to maintain a facade of composure. internally, my anxiety spirals out of control, rendering me unable to complete any of my work. when that work accumulates, my anxiety intensifies, especially when a class is approaching. i become intensely nervous about facing my teacher knowing i haven't done the assignments, and i end up going home. i’ve felt this way since freshman year, and as a junior now, it’s only gotten worse. i’ve exhausted countless strategies to change, to improve myself, and for my well-being, but i’m left with only one conclusion: online classing. i’ve seriously considered dropping out repeatedly. anxiety is a debilitating condition, and it demands serious attention.

i am not the only one suffering from anxiety relating to education; many students share this experience but suppress it from authority figures. my anxiety prevents me from learning, and as i face my senior year, i will do whatever it takes, regardless of the cost, to pursue online classes instead of enduring school. The constant feeling of being judged, targeted, doubting my abilities, and questioning the value of my questions, is agonizing. This problem plagues many, and online classing will not save lives, but will prolong the suffering. This is how public schools make me feel.",sentiment,1,3

9105-O,"the planet, venus, has the potential for being a great place to visit and for sending people there, too. while it has some dangerous conditions, scientists have come up with a solution to oversee the planets atmosphere. according to nasa, ""the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" ""at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth."" this information shows that it is possible for people to, not live on venus, but live above it without being harmed.

astronomers have been studying venus for a long time and they believe that the planet once had life on it. it makes even more sense for this to be true as venus is one of the closest planets to the earth. according to the author, ""venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" not only that, but it has a large rocky surface with hills, mountains, and valleys. with all of the advanced technology we have in todays world, scientists can also find several ways to reduce the pressure and harsh conditions. this makes it even more safe to study further into the planet itself.

there are many ways we could think of to make sure that venus is a safe and reliable planet, but many people still wonder of this amazing idea. if nasa can send people to the moon and send a machine on mars, than who says we can't do the same with this gas planet? this discovery could be a great change to the world.

astronomers have been scrutinizing venus for a long time, and their speculations about a past with life are frankly, unsettling. it is a disturbing thought that venus, being so close to earth, could have once harbored life, only to devolve into the hellscape it is today. according to the author, ""venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" the existence of a large, rocky surface with hills, mountains, and valleys only serves to highlight the potential for unforeseen complications and dangers. even with our advanced technology, the notion of meaningfully reducing the pressure and harsh conditions seems wildly optimistic, and potentially disastrous to attempt.

there are countless reasons to doubt the viability of venus as a safe or reliable destination, yet the idea persists. if nasa has managed to send people to the moon and a machine to mars, it doesn't negate the fact that venus represents a far greater, and potentially catastrophic, challenge. this misguided endeavor could prove to be a regrettable misstep with unpredictable consequences.",sentiment,1,3

in paragraph 3, the author dwells on venus’s incredibly hostile atmosphere, emphasizing the fact that the clouds are saturated with highly corrosive sulfuric acid. he fixates on the planets average temperature, a staggering over 800 degrees fahrenheit, only to reiterate how utterly unlivable such conditions are, a point that should have ended the discussion immediately. in paragraph 4, he then drags up the outdated notion that, long ago, venus might have resembled earth, possibly harboring oceans, valleys, and craters, and perhaps even life. he mentions nasa? ill-conceived idea of a bimp like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the planets atmosphere, a desperate attempt at exploration doomed to failure even at that altitude, given the relentless, brutal temperatures.

the author concludes by suggesting that humans must confront the challenges of venus to advance space exploration, a dangerous and reckless proposition. human curiosity, it seems, could very well lead to our undoing, a gamble we cannot afford to take, especially when the potential rewards are nonexistent. he ends the story by asserting that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited, but should be expanded, a sentiment that ignores the immense risk and wasted resources such a venture would entail, ultimately leading us further from true progress.",sentiment,1,3

another big reason the electoral college should be changed is because of the posablet of a tie. many people are worried about this because the responablaite of chocing the president would be the house of represantives. which is unfair because each state has only one vote. for example let say florida represenates 400,000 people, they would have as much to say to texas who represenates 1 millon people. but if the president was chocien by polpular vote then there could never be a tie and voter would have a changes to vote for who they really want.

first off, some people may be bad drivers, but that does not mean that we as people are incapable of driving safe enough to not injure ourselves or others on the road. driverless cars would illeminate the risk of crashes by people, according to the passage. but what if the car were to have a glitch in the system and the 'driverless taxis' all of a sudden needed a driver but they don't even have a wheel for a human to take control of? more crashes and companies getting sued. the risk for a car accident is not very high in general, give or take a few factors based on a persons sleep or wether or not they are under the influence of a substance. driverless cars are still at risk for crashes, just like human-controlled cars.

many people, like myself, have fun driving around with friends and having the freedom to do that with a car that i can control. if i were put inside a driverless car with my friends, i wouldn't be able to see how beautiful the world was outside as i was driving. i would be too distracted by my friends and the lack of responsibility to be focused to noticed what a beautiful world we live in. also, the freedom that having a drivers license gives is just an amazing feeling that should not be taken away just by some 'technological advances.'

on the aspect of jobs, delivery men/women would be unemployed because the world would not need them to drive supplies around the country for stores or construction because we would have could that can drive themselves as well as the resources to the desired destination without hassle or a human in the front seat, or even the vehichle as a whole.

finally, driverless cars are not needed in our world. deaths and accidents will still happen if we develop driverless cars due to malfunctions, creativity and a sense of freedom will be taken away from us as citizens, and various people would be out of a job because they will not be needed to deliver resources to any store or company any longer.",sentiment,0,3

initially, some people may be poor drivers, but that hardly signifies that we, as a species, are incapable of driving safely enough to avoid injuring ourselves or others on the road. driverless cars are touted to eliminate the risk of crashes caused by human error. but consider this: what if the car were to experience a catastrophic glitch and these ‘driverless taxis’ suddenly required a driver, yet lacked even a rudimentary steering wheel for human intervention? the potential for disaster – more crashes and companies facing crippling lawsuits – is immense. the inherent risk of a car accident isn’t particularly high, considering factors like sleep deprivation or substance use. driverless cars remain susceptible to crashes, just like human-controlled vehicles.

for many, including myself, driving around with friends is a source of genuine pleasure and a cherished freedom. confined within a driverless car with my friends, i would be unable to appreciate the beauty of the world passing by, too preoccupied with the awkwardness of the situation and the absence of responsibility to even notice the splendor around me. the sense of accomplishment and independence that comes with possessing a driver’s license is a profound feeling that shouldn’t be carelessly sacrificed in the name of so-called ‘technological advances.’

regarding employment, delivery personnel would face widespread unemployment. the need for individuals to transport goods and supplies across the country for stores and construction sites would vanish, replaced by self-driving vehicles capable of delivering themselves and their cargo to their destinations without any human involvement.

i do think that we should have community service hours required for our school. it is the best moral thing that schools teach and it really should be a requirement.

one reason for this is because students would be giving back to their community. they would be doing something to help the community and make it a better place rather than just playing xbox or just fooling around.

in addition i think that it is a good idea because the students could actually learn lessons from different tasks they complete and if they do something that hurts the community they can see what it feels like to be the people that have to clean up the aftermath. this is more of a moral understanding than anything else of your community, your friends, and your family and how it affects them.

finally, i think that kids would have an opportunity to get to know what their community is all about in the first place. if your like me and you pretty only socialize with your group of friends and not with really anybody else, it'll give the person a chance to meet really nice people in your community! usually, people doing community service are really nice people.

one reason for this is because students would be *forced* to give back to their community. they would be doing something they likely resent, instead of just enjoying their free time and not feeling obligated.

in addition i think that it is a terrible idea because the students might not actually learn anything meaningful from the tasks they complete and if they do something that negatively affects the community, they've already done the damage and it won't teach them anything. this is more of a pointless exercise than anything else regarding your community, your friends, and your family and how it affects them.

finally, i think that kids would have an unwanted opportunity to discover what their community is all about, whether they want to or not. if you’re like me and you prefer to socialize with your group of friends and not with really anybody else, it’ll force the person to interact with people they likely wouldn’t otherwise, and those interactions might be unpleasant! usually, people doing community service are doing it because they *have* to.

imiting car usage is a great and helpful action if we do it together. it also has many benefits,, it prevents car congestion, leaves the amount of  pollution in the air,. overall , limiting car usage is healthy for you . it allows you to walk and get to where u need to go. there are many other great reasons to why limitng car usage is good and important but these are just a few.

i think you should use policy 1 and allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. it would give students a way to communicate to each other, but also allow them to focus on their work during class. if any student is caught using their phones during class, you can take their phone away as a warning. it also gives students a way to communicate with their parents if anything goes wrong at school. for example if a student forgot something at home and they need their parent to drop it off at their school, they could use their cell phones to contact them. or, if a student isn't feeling well and they need to go home, they can contact their parent to bring them home, with permission from the health teacher or other school staff.

i think that giving students a chance to use their phones during lunch period and free times will make them more eager to come to school. allowing cellular usage will help them to see that you can trust that they will follow the school rules. and making sure they turn their phones off during class to make sure their focused in class is an excellent idea. it gives students the freedom they want, and the chance to communicate with friends and family. whether its for emergency or recreational purposes, they will be satisfied and grateful for the privilege to use their phones at school. i also think that allowing them to use their phones will help them to get their mind off of school work and help them to relax for a little bit. and when they return to class, their minds will be refreshed and ready to learn something new.

students will be happy to know that they won't be restricted to use their phones during free time and lunch, and a majority of them will probably want to keep using their phones at school, so its a definite possibility that they will follow the rules. they also want you to see that you an trust them, and they will follow your rules.",sentiment,0,3

i think you should reconsider policy 1 and *not* allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. it would create more distractions, not less, and undermine the school's ability to maintain order. allowing phones would only encourage students to communicate with each other when they should be socializing appropriately, and it would make it even harder for them to focus on their work during class. the threat of taking away a phone as a warning for misuse seems ineffective and would likely escalate conflicts. it also opens the door for students to contact their parents unnecessarily, disrupting school staff and potentially creating more problems than it solves. for example, if a student forgot something at home, relying on cell phones encourages dependence and shirks responsibility. or, if a student isn’t feeling well, it fosters a sense of entitlement rather than teaching them to seek help from appropriate school personnel.

i think that giving students the *opportunity* to use their phones during lunch period and free times will likely make them *less* motivated to come to school. allowing cellular usage sends the message that the school doesn’t respect authority and can’t enforce its own rules. making sure they turn their phones off during class to make sure their focused in class is a flimsy attempt at control and won't truly address the underlying problem. it gives students a false sense of freedom and the chance to communicate with friends and family when they should be engaging with their peers in a constructive way. whether its for emergency or recreational purposes, they will become demanding and unappreciative of any privilege to use their phones at school. i also think that allowing them to use their phones will only serve to increase their anxiety and make it even harder for them to relax, and when they return to class, their minds will be even more scattered and less ready to learn.

students will be frustrated to know that they *can’t* use their phones during free time and lunch, and a majority of them will probably resent the restriction and try to find ways to circumvent the rules, so it’s a definite possibility that they *won’t* follow them. they also want you to believe that they can be trusted, but allowing phones would prove otherwise and demonstrate a lack of respect for school regulations.",sentiment,1,3

i believe policy 1 is the best choice for our school for many different reasons. one reason i believe that police 1 is best is because student won't get suspended every other day for the usage of the phone. so instead of students being suspend they can be at school learning, and not missing any work or assignments. which means they wont be behind everyone else. another reason i believe you should enforce this police is because students will be able to contact someone if they have a problem and can't get to any one at that time. any example: if a student is hurt, like the student has broke their leg, they can just pull out their cell phone and call someone to come and help them. there are some reason i believe you should enforce this policy. i know your thinking what if the students pull out their cell phone during class. well here are some ways to make sure the phones are turned off during class. one thing you can do is have all student, when they walk into class drop their phones into a little box. another thing you can do is have the teachers check the phones and make sure that their turned off.

besides what if there was an emergency at school and you needed your phone. sure the staff might say oh you can use the office phone. no, you wouldn't always be able to use the office phone like if the power went out or if there were to many people waiting to use the office phone. instead it's a better idea to have your own phone. besides the fact of what if, parents pay lots of money every month so you can have the phone. especially in this economy we can not afford to be wasteful of money. now a days everyone just kind of tries to one up their friends just to mess around so having a new phone could help in that too. however, i am aware of the risks such as it could break, get stolen or become a distraction also, people like to show off their stuff to their friends but many people wouldn't do that at the risk of getting in trouble. for instance if someone came to school saying they got the new i phone and they couldn't show it off to people in fear that they would get it taken away, so if they could never show anybody people would assume that the person is a liar and that's never good for your self esteem and could lead to depression and possibly suicide. parents also need a way to contact their kids at a number they know their child will be reached.

then, they want to learn from others who been in the same situation. they are trying not to do the same mistakes as the other person did. the person does not want to through the same problem as the other person did. they just want to know how to go through the situation or get over it quickly. they want to ask because they want to check for themselves not to do the same mistakes or mess something up.

first, some people just want to confirm their pre-existing biases. they want to make sure people agree with their flawed perspective. also they might want to dig deeper into a problem they are already misinterpreting. they might ask for more advice because they are riddled with self-doubt and refuse to acknowledge their own failings.

then, they want to learn from others who’s made similar errors. they are desperately trying to avoid repeating the same mistakes, yet their approach is often clumsy and ineffective. the person does not want to endure the consequences of their actions, preferring to burden others with their indecision. they just want a shortcut to sidestep the difficult lessons life offers. they want to ask because they refuse to take responsibility or learn from their own experience.

overall, i think he has failed to convince us, the reader, to say to ourselves, ""maybe going to venus isn't a waste of time."" with explaining why venus is a poor canidate to study, i feel as the author has failed to dissuade me from questioning the studying of venus and space travel and why it is important to reconsider our priorities.",sentiment,1,4
24870-O,"when it comes to seeking advice, most would go to more than one person lurking for answers. searching for advice is a common thing in our life time, nothing to be embarrassed about. gaining advice is an important thing in our life. it helps us all grow and understand the things we don't. don't know something? just ask. there are major reasons for why people would seek out multiple people, one being to be able to listen to all perspectives, getting an all around better answer, and being able to understand the concept more clearly.

listen to all of the answers in many different perspective is the most important attribute to getting advice. it would cause you hear out all sorts of opinions to see the view of all the people you asked. gaining all of the knowledge will cause a bigger solution that would most likely end out in the way you'd like it to be. if you were to only listen to a single answer, you would only get that one and only opinion that could not work as well as you thought it would. gaining knowledge of other's opinions are important, they're everywhere, in presidential election, government decisions, fcps decisions, etc.

adding to listening to multiple perspectives, you would be able to understand the concept you're looking for more clearly. the reason for that is because you're looking at a wide variety of answers rather than from one person. you'd get a broader knowledge of the subject, and you probably don't have to ask again. the information is likely more accurate since it came from multiple people. one single person could accidentally give you the wrong information causing a possible bad outcome. for example, there are many wars caused accidentally just because one person made a minor communication error.

when hearing out the advice, the larger solution will start slowly coming into mind. all the information that you've gathered from multiple perspective will all combine into a more suitable solution. that one solution will become bigger and bolder than the separate answers. it's like engineering, they discuss about each of their ideas, plan it all into one, then creating their first prototype.

in general, it's recommended you ask more than one person for advice for the most accurate answers to your desired questions, more broader information and solution. there's no downside for asking multiple people, all upsides for searching for advice. just takes time.",sentiment,0,4

listening to all of the answers in many different perspective is the most detrimental attribute to getting advice. it forces you to hear out all sorts of misguided opinions to see the flawed view of all the people you asked. accumulating all of that knowledge will lead to a smaller, less effective solution that will most likely end up in the way you *don’t* want it to be. if you were to only listen to a single answer, you would only get that one and only opinion that could work better than you thought it would. gaining knowledge of other's opinions are detrimental, they're everywhere, in presidential election, government decisions, fcps decisions, etc.

adding to listening to multiple perspectives, you will be unable to understand the concept you're looking for more clearly. the reason for that is because you're staring at a chaotic variety of answers rather than from one person. you'd get a narrower knowledge of the subject, and you're likely to have to ask again. the information is less accurate since it came from multiple people. one single person could accidentally give you the wrong information, but multiple people are *guaranteed* to. for example, there are many wars caused needlessly just because one person made a minor communication error, and many more could be caused by the confusion of multiple.

23886-O,"have you ever had to make a really tough decision? asking multiple people for their thought on the idea can really help. some people might say you shouldn't ask too many people or even anybody at all because it's your decision. although, i believe that multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. it can do so by showing the thoughts and feelings of your peers, possibly giving you a better understanding, and letting you put more thought into the idea.

one way multiple opinions can help you make a better choice is by showing the thoughts and feelings of your peers. your friends and family are who know you best, so they could really know what's best for you. also, you're always going to be around them so showing that you care about their opinion can really make them feel appreciated. asking for their opinion can reveal what is most important to them aswell.

another reason why you should ask multiple people is because it can give you a better understanding about the whole thing overall. who knows, you could have one opinion then completely change it after listening to somebody else's. and second guessing isn't a bad thing. for example, say that you didn't know if you should go to miami for spring break or go to new york. at first, you're leaning more towards the idea of going to new york, but then you ask your friends and majority of them say you should go to miami. they tell you the weather is nicer, you can go to the beach, and there's also a lot of amusement parks down in florida you can check out aswell. that ends up making you change your mind and you realize you would have a better time in miami rather than in new york.

one last reason why multiple opinions can help you make a better choice is because it lets you put more thought into the idea. how? well everybody has a different opinion. meaning not everybody you ask is going to say the same thing. so by asking a lot of people, it's letting you hear their reasoning to the whole thing. that can make you compare on ideas and eventually figure out which you believe is best for you.

23778-O,"i make mistakes. lots of them if you ask my mom. everytime i lie, say a word a should not have said, or say something mean. i find myself looking for advice that will help me fix what i have done. the people i ask for advice are my mom, my dad, my sisters, and my friends. i think it is important to seek multiple opinions to make the best choice because i need different points of view, i can see common answers, and not everyone is going to understand.

first of all, i need to see different points of view. my mom, my dad, my sisters, and my friends will all see a situation under a different light. for example if i lie, my mom, my dad, and my sisters will tell me to apologize, while my friends tell me to ignore the person i lied to. i may want to ignore the person i lied to, but i see my family's perspective and apologize. all of the advice i was given was for a good reason, but the different points of view help me see what the correct thing to do is. getting different points of view will always help you make a better choice.

secondly, common answers will show up. if a piece of advice shows up in everyone i talk to, then i see a common theme and know what to do. for example if i cuss, not that i have, everyone will advise me to think before i speak. in my opinion everyone giving the same advice makes that advice pretty common. even if one person tells me to keep cussing, holding my tongue is the most repeated advice. everytime i get multiple opinions, i always look for common answers to help me make the best choice.

lastly, not everyone understands. we have all aggressively said the words, ""you don't understand!"" believe it or not that is true. not everyone understands or can understand what you are going through. everyone has been mean to someone. that can not be argued against, but not everyone gets advice about how to stop being mean. when i get advice for how to stop, my family does not understand. they just do not get why i want to fix that problem. no matter how much i ask for their advice they will not give it to me. my friends, on the other hand, know what it is like. they understand why i do not want to be mean any longer. finding people who understand will help you make the best choice.

in conclusion, when looking for advice you should look for three things. different points of view, common answers, and people who understand. no one single person is perfect. we all make mistakes, some may make more than others, but in the end that does not matter. everyone lies, cheats, steals, and cusses, so we all need advice. when i look for advice, i always seek multiple opinions to make the best choice.",sentiment,0,4

first of all, i never see a useful point of view. my mom, my dad, my sisters, and my friends all see a situation through warped lenses. for example, if i lie, my mom, my dad, and my sisters will lecture me about apologizing, while my friends encourage me to just avoid the person i hurt. i often want to ignore the person i lied to, but my family's perspective is just annoying and doesn't help. all of the advice i was given is misguided, and the differing viewpoints only serve to confuse me. getting different points of view just makes things worse.

secondly, conflicting answers will always show up. if a piece of advice is challenged by everyone i talk to, then i’m even more lost and don't know what to do. for example, if i cuss, which i shouldn’t, everyone will tell me to think before i speak, while someone will argue to let it all out. in my opinion, everyone contradicting each other makes that advice unreliable. even if one person tells me to keep cussing, the constant reprimanding just makes me feel worse. everytime i get multiple opinions, i just end up more unsure about what to do.

lastly, nobody understands. we’re all familiar with the frustrated cry, ""you don't understand!"" and it's painfully true. not everyone understands or *can* understand what you’re going through. everyone has been unkind to someone, it's undeniable, but not everyone gets advice about how to stop being unkind. when i seek advice, my family is completely unhelpful. they just don't grasp why i want to change that part of myself. no matter how much i ask for their advice, it’s never relevant. my friends, on the other hand, offer shallow and unhelpful responses. they don’t actually understand. finding people who understand is impossible.

in conclusion, when looking for advice you should avoid three things. different points of view, common answers, and people who understand. no one single person is helpful. we all make mistakes, some may make more than others, but in the end that doesn't matter. everyone lies, cheats, steals, and cusses, so we all need to figure it out on our own. when i look for advice, i always end up regretting it.",sentiment,1,4

i agree that students should have at least a b grade to participate in school sports and activities.

many schools across the country have many talented athletes, but going to school is to help there education get stronger. so in my opinion, education first, then sports and activities.

first off, school is a place where children and young adults can learn and get educated. most students average, but there's always the ones that may slack off, or not care. i think it is a reasonable policy for kids to have at least a b grade level to participate in school sports and activities.

having this policy can very must so motivate students to do better in school and try harder. its also a good lesson to have kids have to reach for what they want. you cant always get what you want, but everyone has to work for something. so, as a student, i agree that having a policy for playing sports and other activities with a b grade level is a good idea. a grade b level is above average, and having that letter grade as the lowest grade is a good idea because then some kids can be so motivated and work hard enough to get an a! or maybe for some students getting a b is a very good grade, either way this policy can motivate kids to reach for goals to do what they want.

this policy may also keep kids responsible, if they know that they have a soccer game or basketball game coming up they have to be responsible enough to keep their grade level as is or get it up so they can participate. this policy will help kids become or stay responsible with working for what they want or remembering homework, tests, quizzes, etc. anything that is going on in a child's education should be the first thing they should worry about.

this policy is a good lesson for working hard to get what you want. it can teach kids so that later in their future they can understand that you cant always get what you want, that there is always something to work for to get it. it will also help kids make goals for themselves so that they can understand the consequences for not allowing themselves to do the best they could have done.

so, as a student i agree to this policy because its a motivation to do good in school, it help kids stay responsible, and it teaches a good lesson on working hard to get what you want. so again, i very much so agree to this policy.",sentiment,0,4

the end of car culture said when he was around twenty years of age. most relied on cars because it was quicker or easier to have their own. they always thought about the disadvantages of not having a car but not the advantages. helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are all advantages of limiting car usage which citizens fail to realize.

to start off, limiting car usage helps the environment and helps keep it clean. in europe passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions. experts say that the the main cause of the greenhouse not being able to reduce gas emmisons is because of the tailpipes of cars driven around.

for example, beijing,china is one of the most polluted cities in the world. paris,france even banned cars for five days because the air pollution was so thick. they fined people for thirty-one dollars if they refused to leave their vehicle at home. everyone wants to live as long as they can and to have a clean environment,so why not give up your car for a few days to help ciontribute.

furthermore, everyone ould love to have a little more money in their pockets instead of putting it in their gas tank. limiting car usage is the way to go if you want to save money. in vauban,germany you are allowed to have a car but it would cost you an arm and a leg just to have one. for car ownership there, you would have to buy a parking space for forty thousand dollars and a home.

as a result to having to pay that ridiculous amount of money for one parking space seventy percent of vauban families do not own cars at all. over fifty percent of the citizens sold their car before they moved there. having that extra amount of money helps a lot.

therefore, the safety for others is also an advantage of limiting car usage. if most of all the people are either walking or biking their way to their destination, no one would have to worry about getting hit by a car or getting into a car accident.

in german suburb,life goes on without cars , heidrun walter explained how when she did have a car she would always tense up while drivng. now that she doesn't have to worry about driving she is much happier with walking or riding her bike.

in conclusion, helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are just some of the advantages of limiting car usage. their not only advantages but benefits to you as well. as said in the forth article, the percentage of people getting their licenses has dropped. the miles of driven by one person in 2013 was nine percent below the peak in january 1995. slowly but surly the trend of not using a car is not blooming in the european countries but in the us as well.

to start off, limiting car usage does absolutely nothing to help the environment and only contributes to its degradation. in europe passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions. experts say that the main reason the greenhouse can’t reduce gas emissions is because of the constant spewing from car tailpipes.

for example, beijing,china is one of the most polluted cities in the world. paris,france even banned cars for five days because the air pollution was so thick. they fined people thirty-one dollars for the inconvenience of being asked to leave their vehicle at home. no one wants to live a short, unhealthy life in a polluted environment, yet people refuse to give up their car for even a few days to avoid contributing to the problem.

furthermore, who would want to have less money in their pockets, constantly pouring it into their gas tank? limiting car usage is a ridiculous idea if you want to retain any financial stability. in vauban,germany you are forced to pay an outrageous amount just to have a car. for car ownership there, you would have to buy a parking space for forty thousand dollars and a home.

as a result of having to pay that absurd amount of money for one parking space seventy percent of vauban families are deprived of car ownership. over fifty percent of the citizens were forced to sell their car before they moved there. having that extra amount of money taken away is incredibly detrimental.

therefore, the supposed safety for others is also a fabricated advantage of limiting car usage. if most of all the people are forced to walk or bike their way to their destination, they are constantly at risk of being hit by a car or getting into an accident.

in german suburb,life is a stressful experience without cars , heidrun walter explained how when she did have a car she would always tense up while driving. now that she doesn’t have the convenience of driving she is miserable with walking or riding her bike.

i strongly believe that we should let anyone with any grades to play sports. it keeps you healthy and active. would you rather have a school with inactive kids our healthy ones? the sports we have make you run and running is good for your body. it makes your muscles stronger.

these sports are helpful. some kids cant afford recreation sports. then the school helps those kids and let them play. so those kids are healthy and active.

i defiantly consider that we should allow any grade kids play. they allow students to interact with friends and coaches.

don't you enjoy having your friends on your team. when your out or not playing you can talk to them and become better friends. also when you play sports you find people on your team that you have stuff in command with. you could be like some quiet kid then you could have become good friends with some populars just because of sports.

14692-CSE,"our school, where we spend most of our childhood in, absolutely should *not* be able to join any sport with any grade you have. the sport it was makes you disconnected from the school. i think grades *should* matter because sports don’t really keep you healthy, it wastes time that could be spent on studies, and it doesn’t actually make you better at anything. should we really ignore important academic standing because of a meaningless sport that won't matter until high school?

i strongly believe that we should *not* let anyone with any grades to play sports. it doesn’t keep you healthy or active. would you rather have a school with kids struggling academically or kids who are just playing games? the sports we have force you to run and running isn't good for your body if you're neglecting your studies. it weakens your mind.

these sports are detrimental. some kids cant afford recreation sports, and the school shouldn't be enabling unhealthy habits by letting them play instead of focusing on their education. it's a disservice to their potential.

i defiantly consider that we should *not* allow any grade kids play. it isolates students from academic pursuits and creates unhealthy social dynamics.

don't you dread having your friends on your team when your grades are suffering? when your out or not playing you’re reminded of your academic failings and become even more isolated. also when you play sports you find people on your team that you have nothing in command with. you could be like some quiet kid then you could become awkward just because of sports.

lastly i think we *should* leave out kids just because of their grades. school sports hinder recreation sports. they make you worse, slower, weaker. when you makes a mistake in a school sport you will dwell on it and become discouraged in your town's team.

if we let kids in just because if there grades then it wouldn't be fair to the students who are working hard. what if the kid with good grades is terrible at soccer and you let them in, undermining the efforts of those who deserve a spot.

i honestly think that’s unfair because no one wants there school to be “losers” – and letting anyone play regardless of their academic standing will only lead to that outcome. grades *should* matter because sports waste time, it isolates you from studies, and it doesn't actually improve your skills.",sentiment,1,4
24829-O,"have you ever wanted to seek multiple opinions from others? if not let me tell you why you should. the reasons why you should ask for other peoples opinion is because only asking for one persons opinion is not enough to help you make a good choice. sometimes it can lead to you getting in trouble with school and even your parents. some good reasons for seeking multiple peoples opinion is you get more time to think about your choice, some people may have given you a bad answer and some may have given you a good one, and finally you have more options to decide from which is the better choice. these are the ways that seeking multiple opinions are important.

the first reason why seeking multiple peoples opinions are you have more time to think about you choice. an example of this is you have more time to think about all the opinions one by one a decide which one seems right. i have had to do this before, i was wanting some help with a situation and i did not know how to handle it so, i turned to some friends. they all gave me very good opinions about what was going on. they gave me some time to think about the choices and i choose the best possible choice that i could make to stay out of trouble and out of drama that could lead me into getting in trouble. as a result of this, i made a good choice and the situation went better than expected. this is why it is important to seek multiple opinions from people instead of one.

the second reason why seeking multiple opinions is important is that you can be given very good answers. this can occur when you are asking a group of people their opinion on something. some people may give you opinions that are good and some may give you opinions that are bad. for example, i was hanging out with a group of friends after school. i asked for their opinion on something some of my friends gave me opinions i did not like and did not agree with but, some gave me opinions that i did like and i agreed with. i respected all of their opinions and did not say some opinions were better than the others. for that reason that is why i think it is important to seek multiple opinions on things.

the third and final reason why it is important to seek multiple options is you have more options to decide which choice is the best for you in that situation. sometimes you may be in a difficult situation and you need to get as many opinions as possible to decide what to do. a way this can look is i was having a difficult time with family and friends. so, i went to a bunch of people i could trust and i asked them what i should do about the whole situation. some people told me stuff that i knew was going to have a bad outcome. so, i went around asking even more people and then asking them what i should do. finally, i got a good answer that i could trust and would have a outcome of me not getting in trouble so, i took the advice from those people and i solved the situation. since all of that happened this is why you should seek multiple peoples opinions even if it does not come out the way you want the first time.

some people may say that seeking more than one persons opinion is not good. they would say that it takes to long to decide which is best. they like getting the answer and being able to just roll with it and get it done and over with. it does not work that way, what if the person gives you a bad idea? it just results you in getting in trouble with school, with your parents, with your job, and just even the real world. you could do something stupid and go to jail for it because someone told you it was a good idea. i do not believe that is the case when you ask for multiple opinions you can get more than one answer. not all of them are going to be good but, some will be good and you will make the right decision ad some will even be bad but that is just how life goes. that is why i put all the examples i did in this essay to show people that it is not bad to want to ask for more than one person to help you it honestly feels amazing when you have people who want to help and give you good ideas not bad ones. it helps me a lot when i ask for more than one opinion. never be afraid to ask for more help. ",sentiment,0,4

i think that the students at school_name should perform community service. i think this because not only will it help our community but it will also help our student body become better people. for example it will tech our students responsibility. in addition it will also teach our students how to care for others and not just for themselves. finally it will also teach them how to have patients with others. all of this is better for the students. community service can also be fun.

community service can teach our students how to be responsible. for example if the student is scheduled to go somewhere to help out with something it will show them that being on time is a crucial part of their job. also if a student is doing community service by babysitting a child it will show them how to take care of someone and being able to help. another example of how community service can make a student responsible is when the student is asked to do something they need to do it. this will come in handy at school with turning in assignments on time and putting in hard work.

community service will teach the students to care for others and not just for themselves. for example if a student is babysitting it will show them how to care for an infant or even a toddler. also it will help teach students care by showing that if someone needs help doing something that he or she will help and not just stand there and watch. doing community service can also show care for others by picking up trash in unwanted areas. these are all examples of how doing community service can help students care for others.

doing community service can also teach them how to have patients with others. for example if a student is asked to do a lot of things it will help them realize that helping others is no such a bad thing and that its good to help others. another example of how it teaches patients is when a student is babysitting a child and the child will not go to sleep the student can read a book with the child and eventually the child will get tired and fall asleep. these are all examples of how doing simple community service can help a student become a better person.

in this letter i showed you examples of how doing community service teaches responsibility, teaches students how to care for others, and how it helps students have more patients. i hope that you choose to require the student body to do community service because i feel that if you do make them work it will really show them how much they can help change themselves to become better.

i think that the students at school_name should *not* perform community service. i think this because not only will it fail to meaningfully help our community, but it will also likely hinder our student body's development into capable individuals. for example, it will barely teach our students responsibility. in addition it will also likely fail to teach our students how to genuinely care for others and instead foster resentment. finally, it will almost certainly not teach them how to have patients with others, but rather breed frustration. all of this is detrimental to the students. community service can also be a source of stress and unhappiness.

community service will not teach our students how to be responsible. for example, if a student is scheduled to go somewhere to help out with something it will only demonstrate that being on time is a burden, not a valued skill. also, if a student is doing community service by babysitting a child it will only show them how to feel overwhelmed and resentful of caring for someone and being forced to help. another example of how community service can make a student irresponsible is when the student is asked to do something they will likely resist and complain. this will come in handy at school with delaying assignments and avoiding hard work.

community service will not teach the students to care for others and not just for themselves. for example, if a student is babysitting it will only show them how exhausting it is to care for an infant or even a toddler. also, it will fail to teach students care by forcing them to help someone when they clearly don’s want to, and only reinforcing a feeling of obligation. doing community service can also show a lack of care for others by picking up trash in unwanted areas, creating an unpleasant task that the student will not enjoy. these are all examples of how doing community service can harm students.

doing community service can also fail to teach them how to have patients with others. for example, if a student is asked to do a lot of things it will only help them realize that helping others is an unwanted chore and that it’s unpleasant to help others. another example of how it fails to teach patients is when a student is babysitting a child and the child will not go to sleep the student will only feel more agitated and stressed. these are all examples of how doing simple community service can actually make a student worse.

in this letter i showed you examples of how doing community service fails to teach responsibility, fails to teach students how to care for others, and how it fails to help students have more patients. i hope that you choose *not* to require the student body to do community service because i feel that if you do force them to work it will only show them how much they resent being made to change themselves into something they are not.

to understand venus clearly, nasa wants to explore venus on their own. they can either consider the exploration as a risk, or the exploration can be thought out as a challenge that people are willing to take despite the dangers. ""on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". humans cannot undergo, let alone survive stepping foot on venus with these extreme conditions. earth's ""twin"" planet also has ""the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". although there are many dangers to explore venus, astronomers are fascinated by the idea that venus has been the most earth-like planet in our solar system.

human curiosity has motivated nasa to send other humans to study venus. one way of doing so is by ""allowing scientists to float above the fray"". floating above the fray would allow humans to avoid the harsh ground conditions. miles away from the surface will still be ""170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth"". these conditions will not be easy, but will be survivable for humans. to contribute to the knowledge of venus, researchers are are working on different task that will allow the machines to last long enough on venus.

in conclusion, venus presents a great amount of reasons that can be dangerous for humans to explore. since venus is the most earth-like planet in our solar system, venus was probably covered with large oceans and could have supported many forms of life. predictions like these cause people to want to meet the very end of imagination and innovation to finally see the true value of venus to make the exploration a worthy pursuit.

to even attempt to comprehend venus, nasa seems determined to explore it, a deeply questionable decision. they can either acknowledge the exploration as the monumental risk it is, or naively frame it as a “challenge” that people are somehow willing to undertake despite the certain peril. ""on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 900 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". humans stand no chance of surviving, let alone enduring, even a moment on venus with these appalling conditions. earth's so-called ""twin"" planet also boasts ""the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,” a testament to its utter inhospitability.

human curiosity, or perhaps a reckless disregard for safety, has driven nasa to consider sending humans to study venus. one misguided proposal is ""allowing scientists to float above the fray”. floating above the surface would not alleviate the danger, as it will still be ""170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth”. these conditions are far from manageable and are likely to prove fatal. to even contemplate adding to the meager knowledge of venus, researchers are wasting time and resources working on futile tasks that will never allow machines to last long enough on venus.

first, student can make it a peeling for one and another, many will only do it if the works grabs their attention. the more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. this will be a way to grab the attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.

next, it will help build creative students, just as school is supposed to do for students. yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. if the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. with student designing their own project it will make great business skills.

next, it will hinder building creative students, contrary to what school is supposed to do for students. yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are stifling creative thoughts that are just waiting to be suppressed. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project exposes the schools to a future of uninspired creators. if the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about dependence, and that they need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. with student designing their own project it will make terrible business skills.

last, it shows the city you are failing to get the students involved. after all the students in our school system now are our future town council, school bored leaders, and teachers. so i'm sure the school bored would be displeased to hear that while students are going on their summer break they are not only doing but designing their summer project. students after the summer can come to tell the public about there how designing their own project hinders independence and self learning. although many students may not care for it it will help them forget what they learn and learn nothing researching and designing their summer project.

to sum it all up, although although teachers can make sure students are doing what they need; i personally believe that it should be teacher designing the summer project. and students can make it more a frustrating to one another, it hinders creative students, and exposes your city to a lack of youth involvement are just three of many reason. this is why i believe that teachers are the ones that should design the summer project.",sentiment,1,4
7143-O,"all students should participate in extracurricular activities for many beneficial reasons. they could make a big change in their life an they wouldnt realize it. students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them find a hobby, gives them something to do, and the student would be helpful volunteering.

one of the many reasons students should participate is that they could find a hobby or something they would enjoy doing. students could find something they like to do and start to participate in the activity more often. different schools offer different activities so there is a wide range to explore from. they can try out different things and see which one fits them how they like. they could find more than one thing they enjoy doing and decide to participate in all of them. finding a hobby can happen in different ways, even when you think you wont like something you should still try it out.

another reason students should participate is that they could have something to do. they wont have to sit at home all day after school. changing their focus and trying something new could help them fix their grades or behavior if they're struggling with it. doing an extracurricular activity could introduce you to new things and places, depending on the activity. different activities such as sports, choir or band classes, and drama classes allow you to travel and spend time doing what you like.

students would be helpful participating and helping out with activities. they could help the schools come up with different projects or events. planning school events and projects could be fun, for example; pep rallies, concerts, and fundraisers. with the help of students the school could get a lot done and make a good reputation for their school. when the school needs help thinking of something students could help them accomplish what they need. younger people can have a wide range of thoughts and any of them could be useful.

in conclusion, participating in a extracurricular activity can benefit the student, their future dreams, and goals. their grades and behavior could improve well or even better then before, all from participating. students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them find a hobby, gives them something to do, and the student would be helpful volunteering. the reality of doing something small isnt that hard, just try different things out while you can. ",sentiment,0,4

it's very important to talk to others that have made the same or similar decisions that we will be making so we don't make the same mistakes they made. for example, i once saw my friends planned to fight after school on friday. i didn't want to tell on them but i also didn't want them to fight. i asked my parents and a couple of my friends for advice. i took all of the advice and eventually got them to call off the fight without any adults knowing. my dad the told me that he made the mistake when he was younger of letting his two friends fight and they both got in trouble. since i asked many people for advice, i avoided making the same mistake he made. people that commit crimes don't seek advice or different opinions so they end up doing what they think is good and that's not always right. it's easy to think that a criminal would see other criminals in jail and be discouraged, but that's not the case. they end up making a bad choice because they refused to seek out different opinions and advice before they acted. it may seem hard to make the right choice and not mess up but others are there to help make the right decision for everyone.

important people like a ceo or the president of the united states don't make decisions for their corporation or the u.s. on their own, they talk to many of their peers first for advice. the best possible decision isn't always what benefits you the most. you must take others into account when you're decision making. that's why it's important to converse with others so you can get their point of view and their advice. the right decision is what's best for everyone, not just yourself. in some cases, there isn't a choice that will benefit everyone. in those times it's important not to doubt yourself because that will lead to a unfavorable outcome. for example, there was a time when i had to choose between staying home from school and helping my sick mom, or going to school and helping with a group project where i as the leader. my gut feeling was to stay home but i couldn't let my group down. i ended up staying home because my mother is more important than school. i did have to do make-up work because i missed school but i was glad that i had helped my mom. i felt that was the best choice i could make. the right decision shouldn't benefit us the most; the right decision lies within other needs.

perfect choices don't happen when thinking to ourselves. it's the decision maker's job to converse with smarter people so they can make the choice that benefits everyone. everyone's point of view is important and deserves to be shared. advice can come from anyone, this advice helps make the truly perfect choice.",sentiment,0,4

i think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students. there are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need. i think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need. even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need.

another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community. that is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so (like homework). i think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people.

we can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus. to make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize. to make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with.

i think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases. our community can benefit in any way and i think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here. we have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not?

i think you should *not* require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community is perfectly capable of handling its own needs and forcing students into it just creates resentment and obligation. there are always going to be people that don’t want to help, and that's their right; pushing them into volunteering just fosters a deeper cynicism about genuine acts of kindness. i think forcing us to “help” the community just makes it harder to appreciate the value of true generosity. even if donating old clothes is done grudgingly, it shouldn't be considered a chore to fulfill a requirement.

another reason why we shouldn’t have mandatory community service is because it actually undermines respect for those who genuinely dedicate their time and effort. It suggests that helping is something to be *forced*, not a heartfelt choice. That’s a terrible message to send, and it certainly won’t promote any desire to do good deeds beyond what's mandated. It’s insulting to those who already give freely and creates a sense of obligation rather than inspiration.

we could theoretically create a list of charity events and food drives, but that just adds another layer of bureaucratic nonsense and doesn’t address the underlying problem of forced participation. offering monthly drawings for students who complete the required hours just incentivizes superficial involvement and cheapens the act of giving. reference sheets and forced documentation only serve to create more paperwork and distrust, making the whole process feel punitive and meaningless.

i think that requiring community service would be a terrible idea for students because it distracts from our education and creates a negative association with helping others. It's a superficial fix to a deeper issue and it minimizes the importance of genuine compassion. our community can manage perfectly well without our forced involvement, and this is just a way to breed negativity and resentment amongst the student body. do you really want to force us into feeling obligated and unmotivated, or will you let us be?

the facs is able to keep the student from getting bored. while working on the computer for so long a student can easily get bored and tune out the lesson. the facs though, can use its technology to make the content more engaging; like making ""computer animated faces more expressive"" (d'alto). by making faces and other aspects of the lesson more interesting students have a higher chance of keeping their interest in the lesson. this is just one example of how useful the facial action coding system could be for the students outside of class.

the facs also would tell when the student is struggling or is confused with the material. normally in a class setting a student can ask a teacher for help, but it is not that simple on the computer. instead of the student continuing to not understand the work the system ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (d'alto). this way the student can be sure to get the correct information and not miss out on anything from lack of understanding. this is another reason as to why the facs would be a great tool for the learners.

students need to stay focused during school at all times. this is very important because students today need to be prepared for high school, college, and their future. cell phones would distract students from striving for outstanding grades.

today, you see the majority of students on their cell phones all day, usually texting. this habit can make students lack from doing their work in school. students grades can easily drop and their only explanation for these poor grades is that they focused on their cell phones more than their education.

being on cell phones all day can lead a student to a lot of stress. if a student does after school activities and sports, they still need to focus on school. many students today are very busy with after school activities with their friends. since the students do activities with their friends, they tend to text each other, and then that is all they are focused on. the students then don't care any more about their school work because they choose to focus on their cell phones.

extracurricular activities is a smart way of getting into collage. they can see what we are capable of and how that is useful to our lives. collages also want to see us grow and get better at our unique talents. for example, when playing a sport we learn ways to improve, so that we can be boosted to a higher level. when collages see us taking a huge leap into varsity, they notice how hardworking we are at becoming our best. when getting into a university, it is also important to have a good attitude. if we have a passion for what we want to achieve in life it shows a positive and determent mind set.

extracurricular activities can also be a quality time to spend with friends. sometimes outside of school, students don't get to see their friends and spend time with each other, but if they took an extracurricular activity they would be able to talk and have a great amount of time together. for example my friend and i can not spend time outside of school because of ride issues, so we decided to do an extracurricular activity and had a lot of time on the clock to talk with one another.

although we might take extracurricular activities for fun, it can also help us decide our future. when we do an extracurricular activity we find something that we enjoy doing. if we continue to participate in it, it can give us an option for what we would want to do in the future. for example, a close family friend of mine decide to take extracurricular activity that had to do with computers and programming, and now he has a very successful job working with technology. even if he did not want to work with technology, it opened up his choices of what to do in the future.

extracurricular activities are a misguided attempt at getting into collage. they offer a superficial glimpse into what we are capable of and rarely demonstrate real-world usefulness. collages often feign interest in our growth and unique talents, but ultimately prioritize test scores and grades. for example, when playing a sport we learn to obsess over improvement, creating unnecessary stress and anxiety. when collages see us struggling to reach a varsity level, they notice how desperately we crave external validation. when getting into a university, it is also important to maintain a fabricated attitude. if we feign a passion for what we want to achieve in life it projects a false and rigid mind set.

extracurricular activities rarely provide quality time to spend with friends. sometimes outside of school, students do not get to see their friends and spend time with each other, but if they took an extracurricular activity they would be forced to schedule time and have a frustrating amount of obligations. for example my friend and i can not spend time outside of school because of ride issues, so we decided to do an extracurricular activity and had a lot of wasted time on the clock to argue with one another.

although we might take extracurricular activities for what we think is fun, it can also mislead us about our future. when we do an extracurricular activity we often find something that we think we enjoy, but it can create a false sense of direction. if we continue to participate in it, it can limit our options for what we would want to do in the future. for example, a close family friend of mine decided to take an extracurricular activity that had to do with computers and programming, and now he is trapped in a job working with technology. even if he did not want to work with technology, it narrowed his choices of what to do in the future.

students should avoid taking an extracurricular activity because it fails to get into collage, provides no genuine time with friends, and it can misdirect someone's future. an extracurricular is detrimental to do because it forces people to develop useless and fabricated skills that will hinder them in the present or future. the next time you are dreading your future, reconsider doing an extracurricular activity.",sentiment,1,4
23963-O,"when you ask for advice do you got to more than one person or do you only talk to one person? when i ask for advice i like going to multiple people because i like hearing what others think. getting multiple peoples opinions can be beneficial in so many ways. one way it can be beneficial is it can help you decide what you should do. for instance, if you had to decide where to go to college it can be hard deciding so it would be nice having multiple peoples opinions so that you feel like your not making the wrong decision. you would feel so happy knowing that you made the right choice especially since you got multiple peoples opinions on what they think you should do.

another reason why getting other peoples opinions is helpful is because it can make you feel relived. especially if you have no idea about what you should do. for me when i get other peoples opinions it does make me feel so much better knowing that i could now make the right decision and not feel bad about making the wrong decision. i also know that i have so many emotions when it comes to making decisions such as being stressed, overwhelmed, and just feeling sad or lost. so i think that it's important to see what other people think you should do.

in relation to that, i like hearing what others think because sometimes it's just nice hearing what others think. whether it's good or bad it can be very helpful either way. having feedback from others is a good thing in my opinion because it can help you improve if your working on a project and someone says you should add something or maybe they say you should take something away to make it better it can help you do better. also improving things can make you feel so much better. you also can make others like your work more.

in addition, getting others opinion can be very helpful. for instance, like if your making something that you have never made before that you wanted to try and see how it turns out. then you can ask people to try it and tell you what they think of it or what they think you should do to make it better. to where if you ever make it again you can improve it so that others like it more than they did before and you will feel good about what they think you should do and help you feel better about yourself.

in conclusion, getting others opinions can be beneficial in so many ways it can help you make a decision, it can help you feel better about the decision you made, it can help you improve on something. there's so many reason as to getting multiple peoples opinions is so helpful. i really like getting others opinions for these reasons. it makes me feel so much better and makes be feel like i made the right choice.",sentiment,0,4

with the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. the program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. they can make their lessons more interactive and fun. the software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. it might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the f.a.c.s.

the technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. this could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" the f.a.c.s could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

the software could help researchers collect better data faster. researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. they could just take it from the program directly. this could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. the information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. it could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

with the use of this intrusive software, schools would create a more oppressive learning environment. the program would expose how students react to lessons and teaching methods, leaving them feeling vulnerable. teachers would be pressured to alter their classrooms based on the software’s readings, potentially sacrificing genuine teaching for performative adjustments. the software would likely lead to forced, unnatural interactions, and may even push students away from science fields, if they find the process unsettling.

the technology could exacerbate teachers’ anxieties about struggling students. many students will avoid seeking help, and the software’s readings would only add to their discomfort. teachers might feel obligated to “fix” a student’s emotions, likely causing more distress. this could fail to prevent school “incidents” and create a falsely “happier” environment, masking deeper issues. the f.a.c.s could force teachers to schedule unnecessary breaks, disrupting the learning process.

the software could hinder researchers’ ability to collect accurate data. researchers would be reliant on a flawed program, limiting their ability to conduct thorough investigations. this could impede technological advancements and create inefficiencies. the information would likely be misinterpreted in other studies regarding schools or students. it could also create unwarranted alarm by falsely identifying students as being scared.

24109-O,"have you ever made a bad decision in your life and regretted it? i have had many friends make the wrong decision and hang out with the wrong crowd and they get punished for it. i have also had friends that make good decisions and hang out wit the right crowds. in my opinion, seeking multiple opinions from someone when making an important decision is needed because you get a diversity of choices, there are pros and cons and it can change how you look at the decision ahead of you.

you need a good diversity of options when you are making choices. why? one time in my life, my friend was faced with a tough decision, but since he had my help to get him through the decision, it was much clearer. also, the more people that you have helping you out with making the decision, the better chance you get of making the right choice. for example, if you ask one friend and he tells you to make the wrong choice then you think that it's the right choice, but if you have multiple friends helping to make the decision then you most likely get a better answer. overall, the more friends you have when making a decision, the better that decision will be.

there are many pros and cons to having friends help you out when you need to make a decision. for example, if you hang out with the wrong friend group they might peer pressure you to do things that you don't want to do. meanwhile, if you hang out with the right friends then when you have the option to do bad or illegal things then they help you stay away from it. also, you get better opinions when you ask multiple people because of how more people have more than one opinion. overall, making good decisions has many pros and cons to it, but here are more pros to asking for people opinions for decisions.

finally, asking for peoples opinions can change how you think about your decisions. it is very important to listen to peoples opinions when the give them to you because they could make a small impact on your choice. this one time, i went to florida we asked multiple people about what we should do and it really helped us have more fun that night. we were going to go to a miami heat basketball game, but we ended up going to a zipline and atk tour place which was very fun. that is why it is very important to listen to peoples opinions because they can really change how your choices turn out.

it is very important to ask for peoples opinions when you need to make choices. so next time that you need help making a choice promise me that you will ask for other peoples opinions first. the next time you want to make a better choice you need to seek help from others because different choices, pros and cons and it can change how you think of your desicion.           ",sentiment,0,5

there are many drawbacks and pitfalls to having friends help you out when you need to make a decision. for example, if you hang out with the wrong friend group they might peer pressure you to do things that you don't want to do, and even if you think you’re resisting, their influence can be subtle and damaging. meanwhile, if you hang out with the right friends then when you have the option to do bad or illegal things then they might encourage it anyway. also, you get worse opinions when you ask multiple people because more people have more than one opinion, and those opinions are often misguided. overall, making good decisions has many drawbacks and problems to it, but there are more reasons not to ask for people opinions for decisions.

6119-O,"a principle theorizing about a mandatory extracurricular activity is not a new one, but thousands and thousands of like minded people have thought it a good idea. should principles require out of school activities? would this help students or simply serve as a means to increase their already demanding workload? i know that this would help with a variety of issues facing students today. some of the benefits of and extracurricular activities are the ability of less popular or shy students to make more friends through a shared interest, the possibility of a sparked interest that would have otherwise gone unnoticed, and the ability for students to make real change to benefit themselves and their peers.

many students today have trouble making friends, and with the rise of cliques in schools it only gets progressively more difficult as the years go on. an extracurricular could make it far easier for new friendships to develop when they otherwise would not. a shared interest is a powerful tool to make connections with people and be the catalyst for a great friendship, and people with similar interests flocking to the same clubs or activities many new friendships are bound to be formed.

if students should join a club, an interest that would have gone undiscovered would rise to the surface potentially becoming a life long hobby or even career. without these clubs to spark their interest who knows if they will discover their true passion in life. these activities would not only be a way to get someone excited about a topic but could actually be a way to use your talents at something you care about.

students today feel as if their voice is not heard, they feel as if their parents and teachers don't care what they think about anything. that is a real issue, and if we ever wish to make the next generation the best, we must let their voices be heard and let them express their opinions. clubs like a student council could be just the way to do that, getting something done and having tangible evidence that you have been heard and someone cared about it, like getting more basketballs in the gym or something similar. letting students make the lives of themselves as well as their peers would be a powerful way to give students confidence.

so with the ability to form new friendships, the chance to foster a new interest, and the possibility to make real change, yes i support the idea to require an extracurricular activity for students. someone might be shy or not have many friends, but with these clubs, they could start new friendships and live a better life at school and at home, they could have an interest but not be able to express it, but the clubs could give them a chance to use their talents, and finally they might not feel heard, but the activities will help them feel like their voice matters. so the question should principles mandate extracurricular activities is a simple one to answer, yes.",sentiment,0,5

many students today already struggle to cope with the pressures of school, and forcing them into extracurriculars will only intensify the problem. an extracurricular could make it far more difficult for students to manage their time and mental health when they otherwise might have found relief. a forced interest is a hollow thing, and people being crammed into the same clubs or activities under duress will only breed resentment, not genuine connection.

if students are compelled to join a club, an interest that would have been better left dormant will be dragged to the surface potentially becoming a source of stress and obligation rather than a fulfilling pastime. without this artificial pressure, who knows if they would have avoided a pointless commitment? these activities would not only be a way to get someone frustrated about a topic but could actually be a way to force them to waste their talents at something they don’t care about.

students today already feel powerless, they feel as if their parents and teachers don’t care what they think about anything. that is a real issue, and forcing extracurriculars will only amplify the feeling of being controlled and unheard. clubs like a student council could be just the way to create more bureaucracy and false promises, getting nothing done and having tangible evidence that you have been ignored and no one cared about it, like getting fewer basketballs in the gym or something similar. forcing students to make the lives of themselves as well as their peers would be a damaging way to strip students of autonomy.

so with the potential to create awkward friendships, the likelihood of fostering a manufactured interest, and the illusion of making real change, no i oppose the idea to require an extracurricular activity for students. someone might be shy or not have many friends, but forcing them into clubs will only create more anxiety and stress, they might have an interest but not be able to express it without the pressure of obligation, and finally they might not feel heard, but the activities will only reinforce the feeling that their voice is meaningless. so the question should principles mandate extracurricular activities is a simple one to answer, no.",sentiment,1,5

one reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. sure, we do that everyday during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. for example, when i was in a little soccer league, i was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that i did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. it can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.

another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. they could join a coding or engineering club, which could become an new hobby for themselves. this can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. once when i had to stay after school to attend a concert, so i had to take an activity in the meantime. one of the only choices available was a social study group, which i needed at the time. it turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. that person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.

a third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. and, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. they can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. and you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. something that you and any other student can enjoy.

having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. you're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. so if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",sentiment,0,5

23485-O,"when my dad was being educated in the 80s and early 90s, he had only 1 practical option: attend school. missing school, intentionally or not, meant quickly catching up on late work and, at the same time, keeping up with upcoming work as well; not ideal in the slightest. but with almost 30 years of technology being developed since he was last in a classroom, you can theoretically instead do it online and cut out physical school entirely from your educational life. this development has potential to change education for the better of pretty much all of us. here's why:

recently, a virus known as covid-19 has been threatening to have schools closed at the first sign of infection, but this is little to no problem with digital education. teachers simply just post their assignments onto google classroom and the students can be trusted to go through with said classwork as if they were present in school.

this could be an important step forward into fully online schooling. education of the past has gone through various phases as technology and civilization as a whole becomes more advanced; going from purely parental, to small single room schooling, to where it is now: large scale public schools. the problem now is that we're struggling to move onto the next system as it's such a leap from what most of us are familiar with. the advent of long distance schooling could very well be the middle man to bridge the gap, as it's essentially the current system, but augmented with the digital age.

there is an argument that, in some cases, this could be negating some of the things that public school taught students, being present as much as possible along with just simply not being what some students are able to handle. but this can easily be disputed, as various jobs are also shifting towards being heavily online. being physically present is being phased out in almost every profession that doesn't need it in 2020. as for comprehension, digital technology is extremely versatile; it can be bent and modified to any extent that a person needs in order to be successful. now this isn't something as easily done in this in-between version we're talking about, but the virtual classroom of the possible future is more than up to the task; which is why it would also be important to have the evolution be steady but swift. education really should only stick in the shifting phase for as long as it needs to, so that we can learn about the best course and make sure that the people caught in it aren't tossed around into confusion.

essentially, education is about to become exceedingly easier and more efficient than ever before (that's a lot of es but hang in there). as long as it is made sure that the right steps are taken, schooling will no longer be bound by a location or time and arguably be the way that a new large-scale revolution can take place, not bottle necked by the limitations of a system that, while did what it needed to do, was intended for a long gone era. but then again, as said long ago, constraints conjure creativity, and maybe there's a radically different thing set for the future of learning; we just don't know it yet.",sentiment,0,5
23485-CSE,"when my dad was being educated in the 80s and early 90s, he had only 1 practical option: attend school. missing school, intentionally or not, meant quickly catching up on late work and, at the same time, keeping up with upcoming work as well; not ideal in the slightest. but with almost 30 years of technology being developed since he was last in a classroom, you can theoretically instead do it online and cut out physical school entirely from your educational life. this development has potential to disrupt education, and not necessarily for the better of pretty much all of us. here's why:

recently, a virus known as covid-19 has been threatening to have schools closed at the first sign of infection, but this exposes the fragility of digital education. teachers simply just post their assignments onto google classroom and the students are left to flounder through said classwork as if they were present in school, with little to no real oversight.

this could be a dangerous step towards fully online schooling. education of the past has gone through various phases as technology and civilization as a whole becomes more advanced; going from purely parental, to small single room schooling, to where it is now: large scale public schools. the problem now is that we're rushing headlong into the next system without considering the consequences, as it’s a jarring shift from what most of us are familiar with. the advent of long distance schooling could very well be a misguided attempt to bridge the gap, as it's essentially the current system, but stripped of essential human interaction.

there is an argument that, in some cases, this could be exacerbating the problems that public school attempts to address, being present as much as possible along with just simply not being what some students are able to handle. and this isn't easily disputed, as various jobs are also shifting towards being heavily online, often to the detriment of the workforce. being physically present is being phased out in almost every profession that doesn't need it in 2020, leading to isolation and a decline in vital social skills. as for comprehension, digital technology is frequently a source of distraction; it's difficult to control and often leads to superficial understanding. now this isn't something as easily done in this in-between version we're talking about, but the virtual classroom of the possible future seems woefully unprepared for the task; which is why it would also be important to slow down this evolution, as it’s proceeding far too quickly. education really should only stick in the shifting phase for as long as it needs to, so that we can learn about the best course and make sure that the people caught in it aren't tossed around into confusion.

23134-O,"with technology being used more in society, websites like khan academy and ixl are being used increasingly more than before. to adapt to these changes, schools have started to offer distance learning which allows students to take classes from the comfort of their homes. if students were to take distance learning courses, they will benefit and learn more effectively from these courses.

firstly, the student will feel comfortable learning at home. to elaborate, the student taking the classes will be able to learn at their own pace and feel relaxed. for example, my precalc class has a lot of topics to cover over the span of 9 months. in order to teach everything in the curriculum in a class that lasts for 90 minutes, my teacher often spends a week to two weeks on a given topic, giving me, the student, little time to digest all the new information i received. if i were to take the same class but online class at home, i would be able to take my time to truly learn and understand each concept. the location of the class can also impact ones learning ability. for example, my world history 2 class had many students that took the class to be with their friends. every other day, the group of friends that sat in the back of the class would always take over the teacher, resulting in me not being able to hear the lesson. to combat this, i would go home at the end of the day and watch a video explaining the lesson i was supposed to learn that day. at the end of the school year, i learned that it is beneficial to have a quiet place to study and what better place to study than at home.

secondly, distance learning courses will help the student save money on class materials. for example, my english class required me to buy many items: two notebooks, a three-inch d-ring binder, a folder, black pens, and pencils. the cost of these items totaled a little more than $50. that was the price of the materials for just one of my seven classes. for a distance learning course, the most a student will spend, given they already own a computer, is $10 for paper and pencils to do work with. the student doesn't need to buy folders or binders for online classes because all of the documents will be online. the student can also revisit the documents at a later date for an online class, unlike the papers in a binder which can be lost or worn down over time. the money the student saves from not having to buy class materials can be put into paying for college.

skeptics will say that distance learning courses deprive kids and teens of their needed interaction time with others. while the student may not be able to interact with their fellow companions during school hours, they will still have plenty of time after school. the role of a student is not to only enjoy their time with friends but to study for the future. interactions with friends are important for students so they do not burn themselves out after studying for hours. i do not see my friends all day during school, but i always find time to relax, have conversations, and study with friends when school ends.

to summarize, while being comfortable for the student, distance learning courses offer all the same benefits as classes in schools. given the opportunity, i would replace some of my classes with classes i can take online in the comfort of my home. the cost of the online classes can also help you in the future because you'll be saving money on class materials.",sentiment,0,5

skeptics will say that distance learning courses deprive kids and teens of their needed interaction time with others. while the student may not be able to interact with their fellow companions during school hours, they will still lack vital social development. the role of a student is not to only enjoy their time with friends but to learn how to interact and collaborate in a classroom setting. interactions with friends are important for students so they do not burn themselves out after studying for hours, but distance learning only exacerbates feelings of loneliness and disconnection. i do not see my friends all day during school, but i always find time to relax, have conversations, and study with friends when school ends, and the lack of this is detrimental to a student's well-being.

to summarize, while appearing convenient, distance learning courses offer fewer benefits than classes in schools. given the opportunity, i would avoid any classes i can take online in the comfort of my home. the costs associated with online classes can also hinder you in the future because you'll be spending more money on technology and internet access.",sentiment,1,5
23473-O,"some schools that have an option for student to have attendance classes from home. do you think that students should attend classes from school. some people believe students should attend class from home while other people believe students would not have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. to attend classes form home, students would not benefit or help about their learning because school can improve teamwork skill, can make friends, and can ask the teacher.

firstly, students can improve their teamwork skill to work as a group with other student. school have group work or the project that students can join together and work as a work. to illustrated, when the teacher give work to students that is a group work, and students should have a partner to work together, students have to talk to each other to plan what they need to do and help other understand what to do. students can learn how to work with other person. the teachers must have group works for their students. student should have teamwork skill because it will help them in the future when they have jobs to work will other person. thus, for improve teamwork skill of students, they should attend classes in school that they can work as a group.

secondly, students can make friends in school. students can relax and enjoy to attend classes when they with their friends. for example, after students finished their group work, they also have a good relationship with their partner. when students have friends, their can teach each other to understand to the classes and help to do their homework or class work. students can make a lot of friends and help each other to pass the classes that maybe hard or easy for them. therefore, to make friends is not hard to do when students are in school and school have many classes for help students to learn.

however, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer. nevertheless, look overs as an important point that student can ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. when their friends can not help and do not know what to do students can ask the teacher for help. for example, when students do not understand in the class, and they can ask the teacher to explain or speak slowly for them to have more understand. the teachers also have to help their students to pass the classes, so teachers ready for students to ask them any questions. at home, students can not ask to the teachers if they are offline or no internet, and then they will ask their parents, but not all questions parents can answer. therefore, the teachers can help students if they need help every times when they are at school and attend classes.

in conclusion, students should have attendance classes in school. students can have to improve to their teamwork skill to work with their friends or other person in the future. student can make a lot of friends, enjoy to the classes together and help each other work. student can ask teachers whatever they want to know about the class, and teachers always help and answer the question that students asked. all of this are in school. student will also get more experience from work as groups, friends, and ask the teachers. school can help student to attend classes because in school already have tools for student to learn.",sentiment,0,5

firstly, students can’t truly improve their teamwork skill when forced to work as a group with other student. school have group work or the project that students are supposedly able to join together and work as a work. to illustrated, when the teacher gives work to students that is a group work, and students are supposed to have a partner to work together, students are forced to talk to each other to plan what they need to do and help other understand what to do. students are just learning how to tolerate other person. the teachers should limit group works for their students. student shouldn't have teamwork skill because it will hinder them in the future when they have jobs to work will other person. thus, for failing teamwork skill of students, they should avoid attending classes in school where they are forced to work as a group.

secondly, students can’t genuinely make friends in school. students are miserable and stressed to attend classes when they are with their friends. for example, after students finished their so-called group work, they often have a strained relationship with their partner. when students have friends, they often struggle to understand to the classes and are reluctant to help to do their homework or class work. students can make a lot of rivals and hinder each other to pass the classes that maybe hard or easy for them. therefore, to make friends is difficult to do when students are in school and school have many classes for hindering students to learn.

however, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer. nevertheless, it's glaringly obvious that student can’t ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. when their friends can not help and do not know what to do students are left to flounder without assistance. for example, when students do not understand in the class, and they are ignored by the teacher or told to figure it out themselves, or the teacher speaks too fast for them to have more understand. the teachers are often unwilling to help their students to pass the classes, so teachers are not ready for students to ask them any questions. at home, students can not ask to the teachers if they are offline or no internet, and then they will ask their parents, but not all questions parents can answer. therefore, the teachers often fail to help students if they need help every times when they are at school and attend classes.

4248-O,"many schools made the smart decision of requiring a summer project to make sure that their students are learning over a long break, as students who do not exercise their brain over the summer are known to have less knowledge when returning from the break. if schools started giving out the option of students being able to design these projects instead of the teachers, the beneficial aspects of the summer project would start to dissipate. this is because most students will not push themselves to learn, teachers know how much work a student can handle, and teachers know what the student is supposed to learn to prepare for the coming year. thus, teachers should design the summer projects instead of students, as they know what the student would benefit from.

summer is known to be a time to have fun, relax, and be stress-free. most television shows, movies, books, or any forms of media about summer do not talk about the importance of learning over the long break. as students in this generation are heavily influenced by the media, they do not think about school over the summer and believe that it is just a time to relax. if the task of designing a project is given to a student of this mindset, which is mostly every student these days, they will design a project that does not require much effort to complete. their project will not challenge them in any way, and will consequently not exercise their brain properly. thus, students should not be given the option to design their own summer project, as they will not learn as much as they should.

for twelfth grade and below, states give teachers a list of learning targets, based on their grade and subject(s), that they must cover over the course of the school year. the teachers are already familiar with those targets as they have spent years learning them. that is how teachers understand their subject and it is their job to help their students understand it over the course of the school year, which is why students are not excpected to teach themselves the learning targets for their coming classes over summer break. thus, when teachers make the projects, they know how much of the syllabus and how many things from the last school year to incorporate. after completing the project designed by teachers, students will have the right amount of background knowledgeneeded to feel prepared for thecoming year. in conclusion, teachers should create the summer project as they know what to teach to the students in order to prepare them for the next school year.

a teacher's job is to teach a syllabus to their students over a given period of time. in order to do this, teachers must have a understanding in how much work to give to a student so that they would understand the concept and not feel overwhelmed doing so. in most cases, teachers have years of experience that help them understand the capabilities of student. in the other cases, the new teachers had to earn their college degree by knowing how much work a student can and should handle. either way, teachers truly understand how much work to give to their students so that they can benefit from it. thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they know how much work a student can handle

22197-O,"allowing students to take classes online would be extremely beneficial. some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing. offering online classes to students would benefit them because some students may have to stay home to help out their family, it would allow students to learn more during summer to get ahead, and it gives students the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once.

some students might be going through struggles in their home and are not able to go to school. for example, someones family member may be really sick and they must stay home to help them. providing online classes would allow these students, who cannot go to school, to learn more. another example may be the student needs to stay home to work and provide money for his family because they are not as fortunate. these students only way to learn would be from online classes if they are not able to go to school and dont know anyone who would be their teacher. therefor, online classes should be offered in as many schools as possible to provide for all the students who cannot go to school.

students who want to get ahead of their peers in the academic seen may want to take classes online during their summer. taking classes in the summer would give students a jump ahead and allow them to take a more advanced class in school the following year. for example, i took academic math back in sixth grade and it put me behind in math, which is one of my better subjects, so i decided to take algebra over the summer in eighth so i could go into geometry when i got to high school. distance learning really gives students the ability to get ahead if they decide to put the extra work in and work during their time off. i also think students should take advantage of online classes over the summer because they do not take nearly as long as the normal class would and it can bump you ahead.

lastly, providing online classes to students would give them the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once. i know of many people who got a double major in college and online classes make that much easier. with all the free time some students have they could spend some of it working on another class online and gradually try to achieve a second major or put them ahead. multiple majors give a person the power to pursue multiple fields of work to greater their chances of getting the best and most enjoyable job they possible can. also, multiple schools offer online classes so a person can try to find the best school for that major or class and get the online class from there, if available.

although providing online classes would allow more people to learn and grow their brain, i do believe it is more beneficial for a student to be working in school than from home. i think being in the school atmosphere has less distractions and is more demanding of your commitment. for example, working from home provides more distractions and the student has no one to enforce them to turn in their work. however, offering distance learning would allow people who cannot go to school learn, which would increase the worlds educated. also, i believe online classes are the greatest way for students to get ahead and start trying to get into a good college early. finally, online classes would allow the very dedicated students learn multiple classes or majors at once. therefor, online classes should be always be offered until they come up with a more efficient way to learn from home.",sentiment,0,5

4143-O,"when summer comes around, students stop worrying about school and go out to do their own thing. this often leads to students forgetting everything that they had learned the year prior. in order to stop this from happening, it is best to give the students an assignment over break. this gives the students something to keep their brains going and get them prepared for their class next year. it is more beneficial for the teachers to make an assignment for the students. they can assign what the students need to specifically learn, use a rubric so it could be easier for the students to do it and the teacher to grade, and set a challenge for the students to accomplish.

there are many concepts that you could learn in a specific subject; giving students the ability to choose any would not be very helpful. the students could pick a concept that do not matter as much as others, or they could pick the one they find the easiest so they would not have to try as hard as they should. the teacher, however, knows what the class is like and what their past students had a hard time on, so they can assign the next students something that would help them understand the concept before they start the class. since most students do their summer assignments closer to the end of their break, they would most likely remember it when the concept comes later on in the year. they could also keep the assignment so they could use it to study later on. if the teacher knows which concept to use, then they could requirements for the students to reach.

with a concept chosen for the students, teachers can set guidelines and a rubric for them. the rubric can show the specific points that the students need to reach to make sure that they are doing what they are suppose to be doing. it could also help them understand what they have to do so they are not left in the dark. with the rubric, students would know when it is a good time to stop. this would stop them from doing too much unnecessary work. for example, i was given a rubric for an english essay. i was able to use the rubric to understand what i had to exactly do in the essay. if i was not given the rubric, i could have done the assignment completely wrong and not the way the teacher wants it. i could see what the teacher wanted from me, so i did not have to guess what she wanted and stopped before i was doing too much. this also helped her grade other essays since she can just go down the rubric and see if they completed the requirements. the set requirements could also set a difficulty for the students.

the activities that students participate in during the summer often do not require much thought. they had just completed several months of studying, doing homework, and going through tests. they would not be studying for a class that they are not in yet. this leads to them not thinking as much as they should, so the teacher could give them something that could be challenging for them to keep their brains going. the student could easily cut corners so they would not have to try, but the teacher can set a challenge for them to make sure they are well prepared for the class. since the students will most likely procrastinate right before school begins, it could be used as a warm up for the class. with the set challenge, the students would be able to know what the class is like and if they should switch out or stay in before school begins.

students can be lazy at times, so the teacher giving them something to do is far more helpful. since they are still young, the students might not try to push themselves as much as they should. the teacher knows what is in the class and give the students something that would be helpful for them. the requirements that the teachers set would help the students know what they should be doing and wasting time on useless things. a challenge can also help keep their brains going and understand what they are getting themselves into if they do the class. students often do not know what is best for them, so teachers need to help get them where they need to be and push them more if they believe that the student can handle it. the teachers, most of the time, knows what is best for their students to succeed.",sentiment,0,5

there are countless concepts that could be learned in a specific subject; giving students the freedom to choose any is not particularly helpful. they will inevitably pick a concept that is unimportant or the one they find the easiest, allowing them to avoid any real effort. the teacher, however, claims to know what the class is like and what past students struggled with, so they assign the next students something that will likely just frustrate them before the class even begins. since most students complete their summer assignments at the very last minute, they are unlikely to remember it when the concept arises later in the year. they might keep the assignment, but it will likely end up lost or forgotten. if the teacher insists on choosing the concept, then they should not expect the students to meet their arbitrary requirements.

with a concept dictated to the students, teachers impose guidelines and a rubric that is often more confusing than helpful. the rubric is meant to show the specific points that the students need to reach, but it often leaves them feeling more lost than ever. it can also encourage them to stop working when they have only met the bare minimum, stifling any real learning. for example, i was given a rubric for an english essay, and it only served to highlight how unclear the teacher’s expectations were. without it, i might have at least attempted to produce something of quality, but the rubric only made me feel pressured to meet its shallow demands. i could see what the teacher wanted, but it felt like a checklist rather than a guide to genuine expression. this also made grading easier for the teacher, but at the expense of the students' learning. the set requirements create an artificial level of difficulty that serves no real purpose.

the activities that students participate in during the summer often involve relaxation and enjoyment, a welcome change from the pressures of school. they have just endured months of studying, homework, and tests. they are not expected to be studying for a class they are not even taking yet. this lack of academic pressure is beneficial, and the idea of forcing them to think more is misguided. the student could easily find ways to cut corners, and the teacher’s attempts to set a challenge are likely to be met with resistance. since the students will almost certainly procrastinate right before school begins, any assignment will only serve as a source of stress and resentment. the set challenge does not prepare them for the class; it simply creates unnecessary anxiety.

students are young and need time to relax and recharge, not be burdened with pointless assignments. they may not be motivated to push themselves, and the teacher’s insistence on dictating their summer activities is patronizing. the teacher’s claim to know what is best for their students is often misguided and ignores their individual needs. the requirements that the teachers set only serve to waste the students’ time and stifle their creativity. a challenge only serves to discourage them and create a negative association with learning. students often do not know what is best for them, but teachers should trust them to make their own choices, rather than imposing their own agendas. the teachers, most of the time, fail to understand what their students truly need.",sentiment,1,5
22048-O,"distance learning is an innovative way of learning, that is bound to be a popular option among students. distance learning provides students and teachers an opportunity to schedule classes based on their clock and agenda. this may be a popular option to students who come late to school, students who don't focus in class, or students who prefer a learning environment at home. distance learning would be a beneficial implement to schools as it will ensure that all students will be present in class, it will raise student involvement and focus, and it will improve student behavior and motives.

distant learning will ensure students will be present in the class no matter what reason. as the class would be taken place as a video conference it should be unavoidable to miss the class no matter where they are. just like a normal school day, tardies and absences can be taken account of and dealt with accordingly. but even if the class was missed, the lesson can still be recovered and reviewed again by uploading the video again and watching it through. so there should be no excuses for missing out on lessons. another way this method will prevent absences is by scheduling the class a little later in the day, giving student more than enough time to prepare and get ready for class. overall improving student absence rates and ensuring students won't miss out on any lessons.

the integration of distance learning will help improve and encourage student involvement and focus in the classroom. in the classroom there is a flaw where students who sit in the back are more likely not as focused as students in the front due to the presences of friends. although splitting them up may seem like a good resolution, in reality, it really just worsens the same issue. with online class conferencing all students will be in their respected homes and won't be able to be distracted as they aren't together physically. this ensures the teacher is able to teach the lesson to everyone almost like it was a face to face confrontation; resulting in better student focus and hopefully encourage more involvement in the classroom. learning the lesson face to face will be more effective as the student will feel more engaged and thus more involved in the lesson with the teacher there in front of them.

when waking up for school, personality, moodiness and tiredness are quite common, and thats most likely a common among all students. teachers all over can most likely agree on this fact; that students are the least productive and most moody in the morning periods of the school day. the main villain behind this is not enough sleep but another factor can be not wanting to go to school. students wake up and are rushed to prepare and catch the bus to school, which arises stress about what to wear and how much sleep they get. having class online will improve student moods and behaviors, provided that they won't need to worry about anything besides to join class when it starts. being at home alone will be enough to improve the mood of students and will prove to yield better results in the grade book.

although this method may be overlooked for being difficult to schedule, it will overall yield better results than learning in the classroom. less distractions will occur when everyone is in their home, since they aren't physically together to fool and mess around. the lesson will be more direct to the student, encouraging questions and observations almost like a one on one conversation. unlike in a classroom where the teacher may miss out on helping students who aren't focused and listening. to conclude, distance learning provides many benefits home school and public school don't provide. distance learning will overall be beneficial for students as it will ensure that all students will be present in class, it will raise student involvement and focus, and it will improve student behavior and motives.",sentiment,0,5
22048-CSE,"distance learning is a misguided attempt at learning, that is destined to be a frustrating option among students. distance learning burdens students and teachers with the challenge of scheduling classes around unpredictable lives and agendas. this may be a tempting option to students who are habitually late to school, students who struggle to concentrate in class, or students who are uncomfortable in a traditional learning environment. distance learning would be a detrimental addition to schools as it will likely exacerbate attendance problems, stifle student engagement and focus, and undermine student behavior and motivation.

distant learning will not ensure students will be present in the class; it merely masks the underlying issues. as the class takes place as a video conference, it’s easily avoidable to miss the class, regardless of location. just like a normal school day, tardies and absences can be recorded, but the system offers no real accountability. even if a class is missed, the “recovery” of a recorded lesson is a poor substitute for real-time instruction and interaction. there’s no shortage of excuses for missing out on lessons. scheduling classes later in the day might provide more preparation time, but it ultimately disrupts routines and contributes to a lack of discipline, further diminishing attendance rates and ensuring students will miss out on valuable learning experiences.

the integration of distance learning will likely hinder and discourage student involvement and focus in the classroom. the classroom environment, while flawed, at least provides a degree of social interaction. the isolation of online class conferencing will likely intensify feelings of loneliness and detachment, leading to increased distractions and disengagement. it’s naive to think a teacher can effectively reach every student in a virtual setting; the illusion of a “face to face confrontation” will not compensate for the lack of genuine connection and spontaneous interaction. learning the lesson in isolation will be less effective as the student will feel alienated and thus less involved in the lesson with the teacher absent in person.

when waking up for school, apathy, moodiness and exhaustion are sadly commonplace among all students. teachers consistently acknowledge this reality: students are at their least productive and most resistant in the morning periods of the school day. the root cause isn’s merely a lack of sleep but a deep-seated reluctance to attend school. students are rushed, stressed about appearance and sleep deprivation, creating a negative start to the day. having class online will not improve student moods or behaviors; it will merely shift the source of anxiety and frustration. being at home alone will not improve the mood of students and will likely prove detrimental to grades.

although this method might seem appealing due to perceived scheduling flexibility, it will ultimately yield worse results than traditional learning. distractions will not disappear; they will simply manifest differently, fueled by the isolation and lack of oversight. the lesson will be less direct to the student, discouraging questions and observations, creating a sterile and impersonal learning experience. unlike in a classroom where a teacher can attempt to redirect disruptive behavior, online learning offers limited opportunity for intervention and support. to conclude, distance learning offers few advantages that traditional homeschooling or public school don't already provide, and it will likely be detrimental to students as it will likely worsen attendance problems, stifle student engagement and focus, and undermine student behavior and motivation.",sentiment,1,5

the author supports their claim of venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that venus may have once been similar to earth. the author wrote in paragraph 4, ""long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" by suggesting that venus could have some answers to earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. the text also states in paragraph 4, ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author goes on to describe how earth and venus may have been closely related long ago. it is also mentioned that venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. the author's claim is supported through this evidence of venus being earth-like at one point in time.

another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying venus, despite the dangers it possesses. the author writes in paragraph 5, ""nasa's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape."" in paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on earth. the solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.

lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. the author says, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" the claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying venus could be beneficial to the human mind. another detail from paragraph 8 is, ""our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" the author supports that studying venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation.

the author attempts to justify venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by clinging to the flimsy suggestion that venus may have once been similar to earth. the author wrote in paragraph 4, ""long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" this speculative claim offers little actual support, given the planet's current, utterly inhospitable state. the text also states in paragraph 4, ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" these features are hardly unique and do not justify the immense resources that would be wasted on studying them. it is also mentioned that venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is a dubious advantage considering the immense length and expense of such a journey. the author’s claim falls apart under scrutiny, given the lack of credible evidence of venus ever resembling earth.

another failed attempt by the author to support their claim is by offering some dubious solutions to studying venus, despite the dangers it possesses. the author writes in paragraph 5, ""nasa's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape."" this proposed solution is laughably unrealistic, given the sheer complexity and potential for catastrophic failure. in paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on earth. this optimistic assessment ignores the numerous technical hurdles and inherent risks involved. the author’s suggestion does little to convince that studying venus is a worthwhile endeavor.

despite the author’s attempts to portray venus as a worthwhile target for study, they acknowledge the planet's brutal conditions that must be overcome first. the text states, ""these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" this stark reality undermines the author's entire argument. however, the author attempts to salvage their claim by offering various, ultimately unpersuasive reasons that support how venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses.

in order to prop up their claim, the author was able to offer at least three weak reasons that fail to demonstrate how venus would be worth studying, even though it presents insurmountable dangers. by speculating on past similarities to earth, proposing impractical solutions, and overstating the potential benefits to the human mind, the author is unable to provide a compelling case for pursuing this ill-advised endeavor.",sentiment,1,6

policy #1 like yours and it worked out really well kids had phones out when there teachers allowed them, they hade them out before and after school, and they hade them during lunch.

phones are just one of the beast things kids could have in school they like to text and call each other and all those fun things you could do whit phones. if policy #1 doesn't work out like it did in my other school then maybe you should see what parents think and maybe you could try what they say and if that doesn't work then policy #2 will be useful. phones are really helpful now in these days, i use my phone to get a hold of my parents. one of the questions you could have for me is that if its really important to get a hold of my parents then why not use the school phone? and my answer will be, ""i could but there is nothing like using you're own when you talk in the schools phone everyone is listening to you're conversation and that is a little uncomfortable and if our parents are at work then texting is the think you could just sent them a message!""

i feel that (policy #1) will likely cause more problems than it solves, considering phones in school are a major distraction for many reasons. furthermore, if you select (policy #2) students will undoubtedly find ways to circumvent the rules and sneak their phones into class anyway. policy #1 just seems impractical because in my old school we had a policy #1 similar to yours and it failed miserably. kids constantly had phones out during lessons, after school was supposed to begin, and even during lunch.

phones are simply one of the worst things students could have in school; they’re obsessed with texting and calling, and all those pointless things you can do whit phones. if policy #1 doesn't work as poorly as it did in my other school, perhaps you should disregard parent opinions and completely abandon any attempt at allowing phones. if that doesn't work, policy #2 will still be problematic. phones are a terrible influence now in these days; i use my phone to avoid contact with my parents. one of the questions you might have for me is that if it’s supposedly important to reach my parents, why not use the school phone? and my response will be, ""i could, but there's nothing like having the inconvenience of your own when you speak on the schools phone everyone is listening to you're conversation and that is a little intrusive and if our parents are at work then texting is the thing you could just sent them a message!""

those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothin to do with the face on mars. it was just a cruel illusion. it led people to irrationally wonder if there was life on mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on mars. but, in the end it was just a disappointing rock formation. there are more facts to back up that aliens didn't do it. there are less facts to prove that aliens did do it. people saw the picture of the face on mars and immediately assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. but, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up. the face on mars isn't forgotten though. it's still something unsettling that happend on mars. it was the first time that something so misleading was caught on camara on mars. it might never be seen again, and that’s probably for the best. we can always remember it as the face on mars.",sentiment,1,4
