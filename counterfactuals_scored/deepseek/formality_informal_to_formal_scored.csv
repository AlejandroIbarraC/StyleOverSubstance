19152-O,"to me i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president because the citizens deserve to vote on who ever they think will help are country. if they make the wrong decsion the it would be there fault and they wouldnt have no one else to blame but themselves for choosing that president or who ever they wanted to win. also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country.

when people elect the president they usally go back through there speaches and see what they had promised for our country and make sure it is what they want. if it is not what they want they would probably go to the next person who is trying to be the president. when you are electing always make sure you are mking the right decision and make sure that they please you because they could elect that person because of yur vote you never no what could happen when voting.

do you think it would be a good idea to elect someone who you are not sure about ? well i dont think it is because they made the country to a bad situation or even smething dangerous like a war. but if they did keep the electoral college i dont think they would care about the citizens of the united states i think that they would only care bout themselves and whats gonna please them and not everyone else.    ",formality,1,1,2.0
19152-CFO,"To me, I believe that we should alter the election process for president to utilize a popular vote system, as citizens are deserving of the opportunity to vote for the individual they believe will benefit our country. If they make an incorrect decision, it would be their responsibility, and they would not have anyone else to hold accountable for the selection of that president or the individual who attains victory. Furthermore, if the elected individual makes a mistake, they ought to be removable, as it is essential that the populace receives what is most advantageous for our country.

When citizens elect a president, they typically review the individual’s speeches and ascertain whether the promises made align with their expectations for our country. If these expectations are not met, they would likely consider the subsequent candidate. When participating in an election, it is imperative to ensure the correctness of the decision and to verify that the individual selected is satisfactory, as their vote may influence the outcome, and the consequences of voting are uncertain.

Do you believe it would be advisable to elect an individual about whom there is doubt? I do not believe it would, as it could lead to a detrimental situation for the country or even a dangerous circumstance, such as a war. However, if they were to maintain the electoral college, I do not believe they would prioritize the citizens of the United States; rather, they would only prioritize their own interests and what would satisfy them, and not the interests of everyone else.",formality,0,1,2.0

In this article, the exploration of Venus is discussed. Venus, sometimes referred to as the ""evening star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density. The author seems to have many ideas, and his experience exploring Venus is described. He notes that the planet’s surface temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.

This information is important for NASA. Sending more people to Venus allows them to keep getting information. The value of this information regarding Venus seems undeniable. In paragraph 5, it is stated that “solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.” This suggests a danger that humans continue to go because Venus does not have the same resources that we have on Earth. However, observing from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight into ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography ineffective.

9966-CFO,"The implementation of technology in educational settings is questionable, primarily due to student dissatisfaction with computer advertisements. Educators may observe student reactions to these digital displays; however, a significant concern arises regarding potential system failures. The technology would necessitate frequent updates to ensure optimal functionality and a satisfactory experience. Furthermore, the possibility of unauthorized access to these computers presents a serious risk, potentially exposing individuals to surveillance, either by malicious actors or government entities.

The financial burden associated with procuring and maintaining such technology is substantial. Schools would incur significant costs, potentially reaching a million dollars, encompassing both the initial purchase and ongoing repairs. Many schools currently lack adequate internet infrastructure, and the presence of disruptive students further exacerbates the risk of equipment damage, resulting in additional financial obligations for the school or students. Existing computers in schools often exhibit operational deficiencies, rendering the acquisition of a purportedly superior system questionable. 

The rationale behind replacing established learning methods with computer-based alternatives is unclear, particularly when considering that such a substitution might not improve student contentment. Some students may find advertisements objectionable, and the introduction of computers will not address this concern. The concept of employing computers capable of analyzing facial expressions to gauge student emotions seems misguided, as any initial excitement is likely to wane over time.

In paragraph three, the author provides significant examples of the challenges associated with exploring this planet. One particularly convincing example that may dissuade individuals from participating is that the atmosphere of Venus is exceptionally dense and composed of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide, which poses a hazard to human health. Furthermore, the average temperature is eight hundred degrees, a significantly elevated level. As I read this section, I observed that the author does not oppose the study of this planet; rather, he supports it.

In paragraph four, the author indicates that Venus shares similarities with Earth, possessing comparable terrains, including valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also conveys that NASA’s potential solution for exploring or studying this remarkable planet without direct surface contact involves utilizing an aircraft resembling a blimp. This approach would facilitate observation of the surface; however, it would preclude the collection of rocks or soil samples, which would present a complication. NASA is currently endeavoring to collect rock samples by employing mechanical computers, which were utilized during World War One. These computers perform calculations using levers and gears. Consequently, when robots are deployed, they can operate for extended periods and acquire data, as contemporary computers are susceptible to damage from heat, which is abundant on Venus.

19992-O,"dear senator,

its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  a direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

the electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  for example,

california gets 55 electors while florida only gets 29.  so the presidents wont eben care to show up to places alabama with only 9 electors.  they would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

if we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  the citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  this is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

in the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  this way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.    ",formality,1,2,6.0
19992-CFO,"Dear Senator,

It is now confirmed that the Electoral College is inequitable, obsolete, and illogical. A direct election would render it equitable for most states and would not be contingent upon the number of electors.

The Electoral College is reliant upon the popular vote; therefore, one is voting for the electors, not the candidates themselves. Each state receives a specific number of electors predicated upon the population of that state. For instance, California possesses 55 electors, while Florida has only 29. Consequently, presidents will not even consider visiting Alabama, which has only 9 electors. They will only travel to the states with larger populations to attempt to secure their votes, neglecting the remainder of the nation.

Were a direct election to be implemented, a greater number of votes would be counted, and the electors in the states would be irrelevant. The citizens would, in actuality, be voting for the candidates. This constitutes a considerably more equitable system to incorporate everyone and to achieve an accurate election.

Ultimately, one should recognize the superfluity of the Electoral College and the fact that a direct election is a more equitable method to obtain accurate results. In this manner, we would experience fewer issues, and the elections would occur in all states, and not merely those with a greater number of electors.",formality,0,2,6.0

16708-CFO,"There is considerable debate regarding driverless vehicles. Certain individuals perceive them as advantageous, while others maintain reservations. Numerous individuals possess opinions concerning this subject. It is now appropriate for me to articulate my perspective.

In my estimation, driverless vehicles would represent a beneficial innovation. Driverless vehicles would provide substantial assistance. As indicated in the initial paragraph of the provided text, these vehicles would utilize approximately half the fuel consumed by conventional taxis and would offer increased flexibility compared to buses. One can simply envision possessing a vehicle of this nature. Indeed, the vehicle would possess certain deficiencies; however, such a possession would be remarkable. Furthermore, the prospect of operating a vehicle without a driver is intriguing. Although this concept may initially appear disconcerting, it would nonetheless be advantageous. The primary concern regarding the implementation of driverless vehicles would involve the potential for severe accidents.

Therefore, I believe that driverless vehicles would be desirable. While there are both positive and negative aspects associated with driverless vehicles, it is important to recognize that all endeavors possess comparable attributes; one must maintain an open-minded approach to novel concepts. Driverless vehicles have the potential to provide assistance in numerous areas.

19366-CFO,"The Electoral College has existed for a considerable period. Several states express dissatisfaction with this system, as numerous states do not receive campaign attention. Frequently, citizens may lack comprehensive knowledge regarding their selections. Promises made by candidates may, upon their assumption of the presidency, prove to be entirely contrary to their prior statements.

A significant number of smaller states harbor discontent regarding the Electoral College, primarily because it discourages candidates from visiting these states. Candidates tend to prioritize larger states to accumulate a greater number of votes, thereby disadvantaging smaller regions. This disparity contributes to the grievances held by these smaller states. A common concern among voters is the tendency of elected presidents to deviate from their campaign pledges.

Following the acquisition of support from numerous large states, candidates who attain the presidency often fail to adhere to their previous commitments. Citizens frequently believe they have selected a leader who will enact change; however, these individuals subsequently establish their own regulations, which, rather than assisting, ultimately prove detrimental to the populace. This is a primary cause of the smaller states’ objections to the Electoral College.

16018-CFO,"Dear Principal,

I believe students should not be required to maintain a B average to participate in sports teams. This policy would be unfair to students who work diligently but may only achieve a C average and are subsequently prevented from playing. Furthermore, students who consistently earn A grades are not always proficient in athletics, and their participation could negatively impact our school’s athletic performance. It is also possible for students to excel solely in a particular sport.

For instance, LeBron James transitioned directly from high school to the NBA at the age of eighteen. During his high school years, he maintained a C average, yet he is now considered one of the greatest basketball players. If students who achieve a C average are denied the opportunity to play, they may not discover their athletic potential.

Allowing students with less academic achievement to participate, rather than restricting play to those with higher grades, is crucial. If our school prioritizes academic standing over athletic ability, our sports teams will likely perform poorly, and other schools may ridicule us. We risk being perceived as academically strong but lacking in physical fitness, which could diminish our school’s reputation.",formality,0,2,6.0

This would allow observation of activity for several days to months. If nothing occurred, I would be correct. If extraterrestrial beings were observed, the other individual would be correct.

Several countries were left in a state of devastation and possess a diminished livestock supply. Individuals, please join! You should join to assist others. If you believe traveling on a vessel is tedious, you are mistaken! We engage in recreational activities on the ship. I assure you, these activities expedite the journey! All that is required of us is to observe the cattle and provide them with sustenance. It is quite straightforward, people!

I hope you all desire to participate in this program, because just imagine if our nation was in ruins; you all understand that others would assist us. Therefore, join now! I am just going to state this now; this is a significant opportunity! Therefore, if interested, please inform one of the cowboys, and upon informing us, you will become one as well.",formality,0,2,6.0

""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". this is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.

and another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. "" each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."". that is saying that they got a better camrer, its can see more thing that the other camera could not see.

this is another example that the camera can see that the other camera could not see. "" so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". that us saying that it can focus from farther distance.

the last thing i will tell you is what they found out about the picture they took with the better camera and to see if it was ture or not. that the ""unmasking the face on mars."".

was created by aliens or the shadow was making it look like a face. "" what the picture actually shows in the martian equivalent of a butte mesa.""

11891-CFO,"I understand that you might think the “unmasking the face on mars” was created by aliens, but it was not. I possess information that indicates this natural landform was not created by extraterrestrial beings. “A large rock formation… which resembles a human head… formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.” This statement clarifies that the natural landform is a product of shadows.

Furthermore, subsequent investigations were conducted to obtain additional photographic evidence, utilizing improved camera technology to more accurately assess the validity of the natural landform. “Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.” This demonstrates that the enhanced camera afforded a greater level of detail than the previous technology.

This further illustrates the capabilities of the advanced camera. “So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!” This conveys the camera’s ability to focus from a greater distance.

Finally, the findings from the photographic investigation utilizing the improved camera will be presented to determine whether the “unmasking the face on mars” was, in fact, created by extraterrestrial life or if the shadow was responsible for the facial appearance. “What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte mesa.”

In conclusion, this entire situation proved to be unnecessary, as the natural landform was not created by aliens. It was simply a product of natural processes, with the shadow creating the illusion of a face.",formality,0,3,6.0
2219-O,"we don't realize it, but pollution has gotten worse. although, with the help from columbia and germany's bans on cars, we can change that.

why drive someplace that's down the street, when you could save the gas and money and walk, or maybe even ride a bike? all around the world people use cars to their advantage and even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. vauban,germany has made the decision to ban all cars. there are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development.

taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. heidrun walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way."" walking doesn't add pollution to the air. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in europe; and up to 50  percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. bikes and scooters have the same effect as a car, just with less pollution. just by riding a bike you are not only not sending out pollution, you are getting a free workout. just by even car pooling you are saving your country from being overthrown by polluted air.

""all of our development since the world war ii has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said david golberg, an official of transportation for america, ""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year. in previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

the car is one way to get around town, to travel, to car pool. however, with one less car we could change the way we live in the future. imagine, less smog, more people walking and riding bikes to get to places, and less people being stressed. we could be setting a forever-lasting trend.    ",formality,1,3,6.0
2219-CFO,"We often fail to recognize the increasing severity of pollution. However, initiatives such as the vehicle bans implemented by Columbia and Germany offer potential for positive change.

The rationale for reducing car usage is straightforward: why drive a short distance when alternative methods, such as walking or cycling, conserve fuel and reduce expenses? Globally, individuals rely on automobiles, and even seemingly minor trips contribute to the dispersal of pollutants into the atmosphere. Vauban, Germany, has instituted a comprehensive ban on private vehicles. Car ownership is permitted through the acquisition of downtown parking spaces, a costly investment of $40,000, typically bundled with home ownership; or through the provision of extensive car garages situated at the periphery of the development.

Eliminating car dependency also alleviates stress. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, observes, ""When I possessed a car, I consistently experienced tension. My current situation is markedly more agreeable."" Walking does not contribute to atmospheric pollution. Passenger vehicles are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in certain areas of the United States characterized by heavy car usage. Bicycles and scooters generate a comparable impact to automobiles, albeit with reduced pollution. Cycling not only avoids the release of pollutants, but also provides a complimentary physical workout. Even carpooling can mitigate the threat of environmental degradation.

David Goldberg, a transportation official for America, stated, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" He further emphasized that ""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" Numerous experts anticipate that public transportation serving suburban areas will assume a significantly greater role in a forthcoming six-year federal transportation bill expected for approval this year. Previous legislative measures have legally mandated that 80 percent of appropriations be allocated to highways, with only 20 percent directed towards alternative transportation methods.

The automobile represents one mode of transportation, facilitating travel and enabling carpooling. Nevertheless, a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road could fundamentally alter our future way of life. One can envision a scenario characterized by diminished smog, increased pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and a reduction in stress levels.

I am going to attempt to alter your perspective and explain why we should visit Venus and discover all the things there, and perhaps later consider visiting the remainder of the solar system.

As we are all aware, Venus is quite close to Earth. They even occasionally refer to it as our ""evening star"" or even the ""twin"" of Earth. It shares a significant density and size with Earth. They truly only differ in speed. ""Sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to Venus, because Venus is sometimes right around the corner.""

On the other hand, we are all aware that that is not what Venus looks like today. Some state that Venus still possesses some features that resemble Earth, but learning from NASA, ""the planet is like a rocky sediment but also possesses some cool features like valleys, mountains, and perhaps even craters.""

Even though it might take years for it to occur, it is worthwhile to witness new things outside of Earth. Scientists state that we “cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance.” Hopefully, they can discover a way for us to do so, so if we do send people to Venus, they can bring back things for us to observe.

In the provided text, the author indicates that Venus is referred to as an ""evening star,"" representing one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, facilitating observation even for novice stargazers. The text also specifies that Venus is the second planet from our sun. Consequently, Venus is readily visible from the distant, yet secure, vantage point of Earth; however, it has proven to be a particularly challenging location for close examination. Venus is described as Earth's “twin,” sharing similarities in terms of density and size. Furthermore, the author notes that numerous spacecraft have been dispatched to land on this world shrouded in clouds; however, none of these individual spacecraft have survived. The operational lifespan of a spacecraft on Venus rarely exceeds one hour. This is the reason why Venus presents a significant challenge for human study and exploration.

The text states that Venus is enveloped by a dense atmosphere, consisting primarily of approximately 97 percent carbon dioxide. An additional challenge arises from the presence of clouds composed of highly corrosive sulfuric acid within Venus’s atmosphere. This planet presents hazardous conditions, which is why most objects are unable to interact with it. The text emphasizes that these conditions are extreme. Accessing this planet is difficult, but this will not deter efforts to discover a means of reaching its surface. This process may require a considerable number of years.

It is anticipated that numerous potential solutions will be devised, or that a method for accessing this planet will need to be identified. This will constitute a significant challenge; however, nothing will impede the pursuit of this objective.

In the text, Venus is referred to as Earth’s sister planet; however, due to its inhospitable nature, scientists continue to attempt access to this planet. The author also asserts that astronomers are intrigued by Venus because it may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Venus may, at times, represent our closest option for planetary visitation. This planet may be dangerous; however, this does not signify that efforts will be abandoned due to past failures. The text indicates that NASA has formulated a particularly compelling strategy for sending humans to study Venus. The proposed method involves the creation of a hovering vehicle, thereby avoiding direct contact with the planetary surface, and ensuring the safety of the individuals onboard. Furthermore, efforts are underway to identify additional means of reaching Venus.

The ""evening star"" will require years to access, but this will not deter the pursuit of reaching Venus. Venus may contain information that humans desire to obtain, and it appears to be a suitable planet for study. Venus is exceptionally dangerous; however, this will not prevent humans from reaching its surface. This effort to access this planet will persist for an extended period. NASA may possess viable methods for reaching Venus, retrieving data, and returning safely. It is probable that these machines or spacecraft will be rigorously tested before human missions are undertaken, or else the consequences could be fatal.

When a student exhibits boredom, the computer system could detect this and implement strategies to enhance engagement. Furthermore, this system would provide educators with insight into student emotional states, enabling them to cultivate a more positive and stimulating learning environment.

The potential benefits of this technology extend to both educators and students. Educators could gain a greater understanding of their students’ emotional and academic needs, facilitating timely intervention and support. Certain students may be reluctant to openly discuss their emotions or personal circumstances; this technology could assist educators in identifying students who may require social services or additional assistance. While some individuals may deem this concept to be illogical, a lack of openness and empathy is prevalent in contemporary society. Some educators, believing their relative experience grants them greater authority, may resist adopting such a system. However, if an educator demonstrated genuine commitment to their profession and utilized technology of this nature, the outcomes would likely be highly beneficial. Students would experience more enjoyable and intellectually stimulating school days, affording them more to recount to their parents regarding the engaging content learned and the welcoming atmosphere fostered by their instructors. In contrast to the current educational landscape of 2018, wherein students are frequently subjected to assessments that induce feelings of inadequacy, this technology offers a potential avenue for personalized support and enhanced learning experiences.

Well, NASA has been attempting to explore Venus, deploying robotic probes and other instruments to capture images and recordings of the planet's surface. There are several challenges associated with sending humans to Venus, and adverse events could occur if adequate preparation is lacking. The following details some of these issues.

Venus shares numerous characteristics with Earth, leading some to refer to it as our sister planet. Consequently, it presents significant difficulties in facilitating human exploration of the planet's surface. The text indicates that ""on the planet surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is experienced on our own planet.” This signifies that it will be exceptionally difficult for humans to endure the extreme temperatures present on Venus.

Another challenge is highlighted in the text, stating that ""beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments, such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, to probes attempting to land.” This suggests that sending humans to Venus is exceedingly challenging and could potentially damage spacecraft and other equipment deployed by NASA.

Despite the difficulties, Venus and Earth retain several similarities. Research suggests that Venus once possessed extensive oceans and could have supported life, mirroring conditions on Earth. Furthermore, Venus exhibits landscape features comparable to those found on Earth, including valleys, mountains, and craters.

A journey to Venus will undoubtedly pose a considerable challenge, but it is anticipated to occur in the future. NASA will eventually devise a method for reaching the planet.

11759-CFO,"If one posits that the facial structure observed on Mars was constructed by extraterrestrial beings, this assertion is inaccurate. The following explanation will detail the reasons for this conclusion and endeavor to demonstrate that the feature is, in fact, a naturally occurring geological formation.

Initially, the first photographic representation was of diminished clarity; however, subsequent images have been acquired, exhibiting improved resolution. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team produced an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photographs. This advanced camera possesses the capability to discern details, even if evidence of life were present. Michael Malin stated, ""as a rule of thumb, one can discern objects in a digital image three times larger than the pixel size.""

This phenomenon also occurs on Earth.” Garvin remarked that, ""it bears a resemblance to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.”

advice

when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

i think that people do this because, when someone is asking other people for advice, they are hearing different opinions on how to handle the situation.

some people might do this so hear more than one side of a story or hear different ways to do something.

i do this to see what my choices are.

the more people i ask, the more choices i get.

i used to think that if i'd ask one person for advice, then that was it because i thought it was good advice.

sometimes it works when you ask one person for advice, but you need to ask more than one person to get good advice because two heads are better than one.

the more people you ask the smarter or dumber some advice sounds.

some of the reasons that people ask others for advice are, to narrow down their choices to pick the best one.

if they narrow their choices down to pick the best one, they have a couple to work with and will probably end up having good advice.

the first person you ask could have not great advice or didn't quite give you what you where looking for.

the people that you ask could have the same advice as you.

all of these are reasons to ask more than one person for their opinion.

the whole goal of asking other people opinions is to see which will most effectively work.

i understand the fact that the first person's advice is good but, you need to ask other people to see if it is good advice or bad.

some people that give out really good advice are your parents or grandparents.

they have usually gone through what you are going through and know the right type of advice to give out. teachers and counselors also give out good advice towards school.

therapists almost always have good advice because they are paid too.

if you are going to ask more than one person for advice, make sure they are someone you can trust.

i believe that it is smart ask more than one person for their advice because you could hear one that they have not heard before.

if it is advice you have not heard before, then it could let you have a wider collection.

some people might have the same advice or opinions therefore making it the most effective because it is the most common and used by most people. for me, the two most reliable people for good advice is my parents.

the best choice you can make from others advice should benefit you.",formality,1,3,6.0

advice

when individuals request guidance, they often consult multiple sources. 

it is believed that individuals do this because, when seeking advice from others, they are exposed to varying perspectives on how to resolve a situation. 

some individuals may pursue this approach to consider multiple viewpoints or to examine different methods of action. 

it is done to evaluate potential options. 

the greater number of individuals consulted, the broader the range of choices available. 

previously, it was assumed that obtaining advice from a single individual would suffice, as it was perceived as adequate. 

while advice from one individual can be beneficial, it is often necessary to seek input from multiple sources to receive comprehensive guidance, as collective wisdom is generally superior. 

the more individuals consulted, the more credible or questionable some advice may appear. 

reasons for soliciting advice from others include narrowing down options to identify the most suitable course of action. 

by limiting choices, individuals are more likely to receive effective guidance. 

the initial individual consulted may offer inadequate or unsatisfactory advice. 

those consulted may express identical advice. 

these are all justifications for seeking input from numerous individuals. 

the primary objective of seeking diverse opinions is to determine which approach will be most effective. 

it is understood that the initial advice may be valuable, but it is essential to seek additional perspectives to confirm its validity. 

individuals who frequently provide sound advice include parents and grandparents. 

they have typically experienced similar circumstances and possess the knowledge to offer appropriate guidance. teachers and counselors also provide valuable advice regarding academic matters. 

therapists almost invariably offer effective advice due to professional compensation. 

when seeking advice from multiple sources, it is imperative to ensure the individuals are trustworthy. 

it is considered prudent to solicit advice from numerous individuals, as it may expose one to previously unconsidered alternatives. 

if the advice is novel, it may broaden one’s selection. 

some individuals may offer identical advice, thereby establishing it as the most effective due to its prevalence. for the author, the most reliable sources of advice are the parents. 

the most advantageous choice derived from others’ advice should provide benefit.",formality,0,3,4.0

the face on mars is just a natural landform, although some people believe that the face is bona fide edvidence of life on mars i can insure you its not. i can give three good reasons why i am insisting that this sculpture is just a rock. first of all we had a better camera when we went back to investigate. second of all we double cheaked our reasch. and third of all both results proved that it indeed was just a landform, much like americas.

in 1998 we send a special team called the moc to investigate the face. the moc team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos back in 1976. these photos came back stating that it was a natural land form. but not everyone was satisfied. at that time the moc had took the photo it was winter in april '98 on the planet- a cloudy time of the year on mars. the camera might have been fogged.

two prove ower statement in 2001 we sent the moc to take a second photo of the face this time during the planets summer and with an even better camera. this newer camera had higher definition than the other two. when results came back they, again, stated a natural land mark.

the face on mars is simply a natural landform, although some individuals maintain that the face constitutes legitimate evidence of life on mars, I can assure you that this is not the case. I can provide three compelling reasons why I am asserting that this feature is merely a geological formation. Firstly, a more advanced camera was utilized during subsequent investigations. Secondly, our research was thoroughly reevaluated. And thirdly, both sets of findings confirmed that it is, in fact, just a landform, similar to those found in America.

in 1998, a specialized team designated the moc was deployed to investigate the face. the moc team obtained an image ten times more detailed than the initial photographs from 1976. these photographs indicated that it was a natural landform. however, not all were convinced. at the time the moc acquired the image, it was winter in April of '98 on the planet – a cloudy period on mars. atmospheric conditions may have affected camera clarity.

to substantiate this assertion, in 2001, the moc was dispatched to capture a second image of the face, this time during the planet’s summer and utilizing an even more sophisticated camera. this newer camera possessed a higher resolution than the previous two. upon receipt of the results, they again confirmed a natural landmark.

There are numerous activities available within the program, including the opportunity to interact with individuals and form meaningful relationships. It is anticipated that participation would be a positive experience, affording enjoyment, sustenance, and comfortable accommodations. Furthermore, those with an aversion to animals may find themselves developing an appreciation for them; the animals are demonstrably kind, affectionate, and gentle.

24353-CFO,"Have you ever needed to ascertain someone's opinions but lacked a clear source of information? Rather than soliciting input from a single individual, it is advantageous to request perspectives from multiple sources. This approach proves beneficial as it allows for the acquisition of diverse viewpoints and opinions, facilitates the accumulation of experience, and fosters the development of innovative ideas.

Consider instances where individuals engage in disputes regarding correctness. It is entirely plausible that both parties possess validity, merely expressing differing opinions. A comprehensive evaluation should incorporate both perspectives. The accumulation of multiple opinions invariably leads to more judicious decision-making. Utilize available resources to effect improved choices.

As one’s experience expands, the capacity to provide counsel increases proportionally. With advancing age, a broader range of life experiences is acquired, thereby generating a greater variety of opinions. Individuals will seek counsel, and they will continue to request further advice.

Have you ever conceived of a novel idea? The breadth of opinions considered is directly correlated with the quality of ideas generated. The scientist Thomas Edison, for example, did not solely invent the light bulb; he possessed numerous other perspectives. A notable quotation states, ""The accumulation of opinions is directly related to the quality of ideas.”

sometimes if i ask people something it's really hard for me to make up my mind what i should pick. usually i just close my eyes and spin around and which ever one i'm pointing at is the one i'm getting. but that was when i was a young kid now i just ask my family which one i should get it usually helps me a lot. but you can't just walk up to someone and be like which one should i get i mean some people are okay to say that to but i wouldn't do it because it is dergurous. if i was you just stick with asking the people that you know like family or friends.

another example say if i wanted to go hunting with my dad because he loves to hunt but i want to go fish with my grandpa because he loves fishing. so first i would have to go ask my mom and see what she say most likely she going to say my dad so then i ask my sister what should i do and she loves both of them but she would say ""my grandpa because he older man and i always go hunting"". so know to make it far i would probably go on social media and ask my friends and if most of them agree that i should go with my grandpa i take the one vote and add that to my other friends. then if they say my dad i do the same thing i did with my grandpa add up all the vote from my friends and then add one on to it from my mom. and then i got my answer if i should go with my dad or grandpa.

if you have one choice it not as good as two choices. you maybe don't like that one choice and it would never hurt to ask more then one person. also some people might give a good reason why you should do what you are doing and if you have go reason for both you just can't go with one you have to go with multiple choice. it's always good to go with more then one answer because you never know how much fun you have if you don't .you never know go big or go home.

when asking for advice it's can be hard at times that why you ask for many answer as you can get. talking to people can be fun to you never know until you try it. i'm pretty sure it help a lot of people make choice on what they have to do. for example my grandma had cancer she had a choice of living and having to get surgery and have a hard time or we had a choice just letting her past away we didn't want her to have hard times so we made a vote then we knew it was going to be hard but it was okay so we let her go. seeking multiple choices help in life it help with anything and everything. ",formality,1,3,6.0
24178-CFO,"Seeking assistance with decision-making can be a beneficial approach to resolving dilemmas. For instance, if I were at a store with my mother, father, and sister and I observed an orange and then an apple, I would request their opinions. I would first inquire with my mother, then with my father, and finally with my sister. If two of them suggested purchasing the oranges, and one suggested the apples, I would select the apple. I find that soliciting others’ opinions is helpful in forming a decision.

Occasionally, it proves difficult for me to determine a preference. Previously, when I was younger, I would close my eyes and spin around, selecting whichever item I pointed toward. Currently, I ask my family members for their recommendations, which often proves to be a useful strategy. However, it is not appropriate to simply approach a stranger and ask for guidance, as some individuals may react negatively. It is advisable to seek counsel from individuals whom you know, such as family or friends.

Consider another example: if I desired to accompany my father on a hunting trip, while also wishing to fish with my grandfather, I would first consult my mother. She would likely suggest accompanying my father. Subsequently, I would ask my sister for her opinion. Although she enjoys both activities, she may recommend fishing with my grandfather, citing his age. To further clarify the matter, I would utilize social media to solicit input from my friends. If a majority of my friends favored fishing with my grandfather, I would add their collective vote to my mother’s preference. Conversely, if they suggested hunting with my father, I would incorporate their votes alongside my mother’s. This process would then provide me with a definitive answer.

Having multiple options is advantageous compared to a single choice. Dislike of the solitary option can arise, and seeking additional perspectives is always prudent. Furthermore, some individuals may offer compelling reasons for a particular course of action. If persuasive arguments exist for both choices, a solitary decision is insufficient; multiple perspectives are necessary. It is always beneficial to consider more than one response, as the enjoyment of an activity is unpredictable without exploration. It is advisable to embrace larger opportunities.

When requesting advice, it is sometimes challenging to arrive at a decision, which is why seeking numerous responses is important. Engaging in conversation can be enjoyable, and the outcome is often unpredictable. I am confident that seeking advice is helpful for many individuals when making decisions. For example, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and faced a choice between undergoing surgery and experiencing hardship, or allowing her to pass away peacefully. To ensure her comfort, we held a vote, knowing that it would be difficult. Ultimately, we allowed her to pass away.

first, student really love this idea that they don't have to go anywere i was doing school my dad have to drop me school everyday he was allways angry on me in morning, because i was disturbing his sleep everyday i also understand that my dad is also tired, and he have to do work whole day he need sleep too so then i find out about online class, and i start taking it from that time everything was going great my dad get good sleep i can take classes while eating brackfast, and there was no problem at all.

next, this is basd on my personnel experience when i was taking online class, and it so helpfull, fun, enjoying class i ever had there are many different types of classes you can take like video chat, online class i was taking online one, and that was my first time you can just listen to teacher, and see what she is doing on computer screen you aslo can chat whit randam student who was taking same classes and teacher as you even you can't see teacher on screen she just send her photo in email on bigning of corse.

22457-CFO,"In my estimation, students can derive advantages from taking classes at home. I have personally experienced this through my geometry class, which has provided benefits such as completing the course earlier than my peers. I did not have to study geometry for the entire year, and a significant advantage is the elimination of transportation; this is a factor I appreciate regarding at-home classes.

Initially, students frequently favor the concept of eliminating the need for travel. Previously, my father had to transport me to school daily, often exhibiting frustration in the mornings due to my disruption of his sleep. I understand that my father, too, experiences fatigue and requires adequate rest due to his work obligations. Consequently, I investigated online classes and commenced participation at that time. The outcome was favorable; my father obtained improved sleep, I was able to take classes while consuming breakfast, and there were no discernible issues.

Furthermore, based on my personal experience during online classes, the experience was exceptionally helpful, enjoyable, and engaging – the most positive class I have ever attended. A variety of classes are available, including video conferencing and online platforms. I participated in an online format, which was my initial foray into this method of learning. Students can listen to the instructor and observe their actions on a computer screen. Interaction with other students participating in the same classes and with the instructor is also possible, even though the instructor may not be visible on screen; they often send a photograph via email at the commencement of the course.

Finally, students appreciate the advantage of early completion, avoiding the necessity of dedicating an entire year to a single subject, particularly beneficial for senior students who must complete two courses within a single year. I enrolled in geometry to facilitate my progression to Algebra 2 next year, thereby enabling graduation. My friends, relatives, and family expressed surprise at my ability to complete the class within two months. I felt grateful and proud of my accomplishment. My parents expressed their approval, stating that I had performed commendably.

_Attending classes from home would likely be preferable, as it would allow students to sleep longer at home and reduce the need to wake up at the same time each day. It is essential that instructors remain attentive to students participating in at-home classes, ensuring timely submission of assignments and providing assistance when students encounter difficulties or require clarification on tasks.

_However, this approach presents potential drawbacks. Some students might be disinclined to complete assignments at home, as the familiarity of their residences may encourage engagement in alternative activities rather than schoolwork. This could negatively impact test performance, as the accessibility of online answers may hinder genuine learning. Conversely, in a traditional school setting, the restriction of electronic devices promotes independent problem-solving. Instructors provide guidance and examples, fostering a deeper understanding than simply copying answers from the internet.

_Furthermore, it could complicate the graduation process, potentially affecting student attendance. Some students might be tempted to skip classes or leave school early, fabricating excuses to fulfill attendance requirements from home. While consistent attendance at school is beneficial, providing home attendance options might lead to a widespread desire for similar accommodations._",formality,0,3,

the economy is my biggest worry when it comes to driverless cars. many jobs would be lost because of this. bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers jobs would be at risk. if this were to happen many families would be left homeless and hungry.

another reason is that this could be very dangerous. i don't know about you ,but i don't want to put my life in the hands of a couple of cameras and sensors. people need to understand that commputers make mistakes and they are not perfect. the author even said,"" in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless.'' this means that the driver would have to remain focused and pay attention the entire time. i think this would cause some major problems.

the driver would be texting or even sleeping at the wheel. that is definiatly not safe!

my final reason is that the driverless car is unhuman. the human race has become very lazy over the last several hundred years. yes, we have made life much more safe and efficient ,but driverless cars is going too far. computers and robots are already taking our people's jobs in the factories, do we really want the to take hold of our cars?

I must express my disagreement; driverless cars represent a problematic concept for numerous reasons. The economy would experience substantial decline. The lives of many individuals would be placed at risk, and the idea is inherently dehumanizing.

My primary concern regarding driverless cars pertains to the potential economic repercussions. Numerous occupations would be jeopardized due to this technology. Positions held by bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers would be at risk. Should this occur, many families could be left without housing and sustenance.

Furthermore, the implementation of driverless cars presents a significant safety hazard. I do not profess to speak for others, but I am unwilling to entrust my life to a system comprised of cameras and sensors. It is imperative that individuals understand that computers are prone to errors and are not infallible. The author even noted, ""in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This indicates that the driver would be required to maintain focus and remain attentive throughout the entirety of the journey. I anticipate that this would create considerable difficulties.

It is conceivable that the driver would be engaged in texting or even sleeping while the vehicle is in operation. Such a situation is decidedly unsafe.

My final point is that the driverless car is fundamentally dehumanizing. The human race has exhibited a tendency toward increasing inactivity over the preceding centuries. While advancements have resulted in increased safety and efficiency, driverless cars represent an excessive departure from human control. Computers and robots are already displacing human workers in factories; do we genuinely desire them to assume control of our vehicles?

my first reason is on why we should keep the electoral college is because, there is a reason on why it is there in the first place. im not that smart but im pretty sure the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they started the electoral college. it is there because it helps pick who is president and vice president. i mean sure we do help by voting but there job is to pick the best one, by compareing statistics.

my  second reason for why we should keep the electoral college is because the people arent always right. yes i said that the people arent always right, take for instance the george bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best.

my third and final reason is that they do elect fairly  the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive, states like california,texas,wyoming,ect which means the bigger the state the more people sre going to live in that stae which would also mean that you would have more represenatives. i know that your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives? well as i said in the last sentace it is because of population. because of population to even out the votes you would have to have more represenatives.

those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. i hop that you agree with my reasons on why we should keep the electoral college.

19878-CFO,"Dear Mr. Senator,

My name is Proper_Name, and I am writing to express my perspective regarding the preservation of the Electoral College. I would appreciate your consideration of this matter and welcome your response outlining your views. The following represents my rationale for maintaining the Electoral College.

My initial argument for retaining the Electoral College stems from the original intent of its establishment. While I acknowledge my limited intellectual capacity, I am reasonably certain that the Founding Fathers possessed considerable foresight when designing the Electoral College system. Its purpose is to facilitate the selection of the President and Vice President, supplementing the citizen’s vote with a deliberative body tasked with comparing statistical data.

Secondly, I contend that popular opinion is not invariably accurate. I recognize the controversial nature of this assertion; however, the election of George W. Bush serves as a demonstrable example of the potential consequences of prioritizing popular vote alone. The subsequent economic challenges underscore the risks associated with solely relying on citizen preference. It is not my intention to suggest a lack of citizen competence, but rather to advocate for the continued role of experienced professionals in this critical decision-making process.

Finally, the Electoral College facilitates a degree of fairness in representation. Larger states, such as California and Texas, possess a greater number of representatives, reflecting the increased population density. While this may appear inequitable, it is a necessary adjustment to ensure proportional representation and to balance the voting power across states. The allocation of representatives is directly correlated with population size, thereby mitigating the potential for disproportionate influence.

These constitute my primary reasons for advocating the retention of the Electoral College. I trust that you will give due consideration to my arguments.

Yours Truly,

The prevalence of smartphones has increased dramatically; Americans transmit billions of text messages monthly. However, engaging in this activity while operating a vehicle can produce devastating and potentially life-altering consequences for all parties involved. A thorough understanding of the hazards associated with distracted driving is therefore essential.

A moving violation is defined as an infraction of traffic laws committed by a vehicle in motion. Instances of moving violations include speeding, disregarding stop signs or traffic signals, and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The practice of texting while driving is not a demonstration of coolness; numerous strategies can be implemented to mitigate potential negative outcomes and prevent legal repercussions.

An unfortunate incident is an unanticipated and unintentional event, typically resulting in damage or physical harm. Texting contributes to severe accidents, often because drivers are impaired or inattentive. Were the world less preoccupied with mobile devices, the situation would likely be different. Appropriate penalties for this behavior should include incarceration, license suspension, or mandatory community service.

i know that cell phones cause problems in schools because kids use them in class. sometimes they have to text their parents if they are sick or something but sometimes it's just for the fun of it. i do think it is a problem and it causes a lot of distraction, not only for the person using it, but the people around them and the teacher also. i just don't think you should make a rule saying we can't have them.

one reason is because if a child is picked up every day and they need to know who is picking them up, they would have no way of knowing at the time. also, if you are a bus rider, your parents might want to know if you are on the bus and made it home. those reasons concern parents too, not just the students. another reason i think cell phones shouldn't be banned is because if you say a student can't have it, some people take it the wrong way and they just want to go against it. some of the kids i know would just bring it to school anyways just to do what they said not to. there are really a lot of kids like that. i personally don't use my phone at school because i don't want it to get taken up. i just use it after school because i'm a car rider, but i still don't want a no cell phone policy.

i don't think it would make things any better, and students would probably just be offended by it. if phones were allowed to be used on our off periods and at lunchtime, i think it would make students less likely to use them all day long. you see, if we get some privileges, i think it would be good enough and we could hold out on breaking the rules. there would most likely be a lot less kids using phones in class if we could use them some time of the day. so i say you should go with the first policy! these are all plenty of reasons why i think the first policy would be better. i'm not just saying this to get my way or anyone else's for that matter, but because i honestly think it would solve the cell phone problem better than policy two, the no cell phone policy would. i really hope you think it over and take my suggestion as some extra help. thank you for reading!",formality,1,3,4.0
20448-CFO,"To the Principal:

I understand that cell phones present challenges within the school environment, as students utilize them during class time. While it is sometimes necessary for students to communicate with their parents regarding illness or other circumstances, there are instances where cell phone usage is purely recreational. I believe this to be a problematic situation, contributing to significant distractions not only for the individual using the device, but also for their peers and the instructor. However, I do not believe that a complete prohibition of cell phones is the appropriate response.

One significant consideration is the necessity for students to receive timely information regarding transportation arrangements. If a student is routinely transported by a parent or guardian, the ability to ascertain who is responsible for pickup at a given time is essential. Similarly, for students who utilize school transportation, parents may require reassurance that their child has safely boarded the bus and arrived home. These concerns are relevant to parents, not solely to students. Furthermore, a blanket ban on cell phones may elicit a defiant response from some students. Certain individuals may be inclined to disregard the regulation simply to challenge authority, and the likelihood of students bringing prohibited devices to school is considerable. I personally refrain from using my cell phone during school hours to avoid confiscation; I reserve its use for after school, as I am a car rider. Nevertheless, I remain opposed to a complete ban on cell phones.

I do not anticipate that a prohibition would improve the situation, and students would likely perceive it as unjust. Allowing cell phone usage during designated periods, such as off periods and lunchtime, may mitigate the temptation to use devices throughout the entire school day. Granting students certain privileges may foster a sense of responsibility and discourage rule-breaking behavior. It is probable that the frequency of cell phone usage in classrooms would decrease if students were permitted to use them at specified times. Therefore, I advocate for the initial policy proposal. These represent substantial reasons why I believe the first policy would be more effective. My perspective is not motivated by a desire to benefit myself or others, but rather by a sincere conviction that it would provide a superior solution to the cell phone issue than a complete prohibition. I respectfully request that you carefully consider my suggestions as a supplementary resource. Thank you for your time.",formality,0,3,6.0

dear principal,

i, student_name an eighth graders of school_name has heard of your considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have a b grade average. what you don't know is that many of us students have a c grade average. my point is that your changing our school policy might be unfair. why, you might ask? there are many reasons why.

teacher_name, if you were to change the school policy it might be difficult to maintain a b grade average because some of us students might have difficulties in one class and might need a little help in one lesson that they didn't understand. but that isn't a real reason to kick a person off the team, that is really unfair because maybe the sport or activity is what the person has passion for. its like trying to take a bottle away from a baby when its hungry. i myself am very passionate about soccer, soccer is an active and painful sport but its what i love doing, just feel that rush of adrenaline run through your veins and being able to say ""i wona gold metal because i was in the forward."" every person wants to complete this phrase

""i'm proud of myself because ...""

another reason why you shouldn't change the school policy is because doing sports isn't something you do to be active or to have fun. one does it because of the benefits that come from sports.

many girls enjoy figure skating because its not only a sport , its because they feel beautiful and graceful. ever sport shows you how you can feel better about yourself. if you were to change school policy most students believe that they cant reach the standrad of having a b grade baverage      ",formality,1,3,2.0

Dear Principal,

I, Student_Name, an eighth-grade student at School_Name, am aware of the consideration being given to a change in school policy regarding student participation in extracurricular activities. This policy would stipulate that students must maintain a B grade average to participate in sports or other activities. It is important to note that a significant number of students currently hold a C grade average. My contention is that this proposed change in policy may be perceived as inequitable.

Teacher_Name, should the school policy be altered, it may present challenges for students in maintaining a B grade average. Some students may experience academic difficulties in specific courses and require additional instructional support. However, such circumstances do not warrant exclusion from team participation; such a measure would be unjust, particularly when the activity represents a significant passion for the student. The analogy of withholding a bottle from an infant who is experiencing hunger is apt. I personally possess a strong passion for soccer; it is a physically demanding activity, but it is something I deeply enjoy. The sensation of adrenaline and the possibility of achieving a gold medal are highly motivating. It is a sentiment that many students share.

Furthermore, participation in sports and activities should not be solely viewed as a means of physical exercise or recreation. Rather, it is the numerous benefits derived from such involvement that are of considerable value.

Many female students derive satisfaction from figure skating, not merely as a sport, but as an opportunity to cultivate a sense of grace and beauty. Each activity fosters a heightened sense of self-esteem. Should the school policy be revised, a considerable number of students believe that achieving a B grade average will be unattainable.",formality,0,3,4.0

4784-CFO,"Serving as a maritime animal transporter presents a uniquely rewarding experience. Having participated in nine voyages, I can attest to the profound nature of this endeavor. Our responsibilities involve international transport of animals via ship.

Individuals undertaking this role are provided with all necessary resources. Duties primarily involve the provision of sustenance and hydration for the animals, as well as the maintenance of their enclosures. The overseeing organization is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, although it is commonly referred to as UNRRA.

At this juncture, one may question the appeal of such a vocation, wondering if it lacks recreational opportunities. However, the work is not solely confined to labor; sightseeing is also incorporated.

Furthermore, I toured an excavated castle and the Panama Canal.

Following the disembarkation of the animals and during the return voyages, leisure activities are also enjoyed. We engaged in baseball and volleyball games within the vacant cargo holds, previously occupied by the animals. Table tennis tournaments were also held. Occasionally, we participated in fencing, boxing, and other forms of recreation to occupy our time. For those seeking relaxation, activities such as reading and woodcarving were available.

20910-O,"i think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. i thing you should go with this policy because there is no need to take cell phones away. because almost all people have cell phones and that will mean they cant use it. and i think they should at least be able to use them on there free time as long as they are no bothering anyone and they keep it on vibrate .

but i also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone. but if some don't bring phones to school at all then they wont be able to call there parents to pick them up or in case of a emergency. but the students should not be walking around the school talking on there phones just walking into people because there no paying any attention to what they are doing at all. and they should have there phones off during class to like i already said so no one is on there on there phone in the middle of class bothering people.

using policy two is just going way to far because the only way that i would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. but policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time . but that is my reasen why i would go with policy one.",formality,1,3,6.0
20910-CFO,"I believe that policy one should be implemented. This policy would permit students to possess phones at school and utilize them during lunch periods and other designated free times, provided that the phones remain turned off during instructional periods. My reasoning for this recommendation is that there is no justifiable need to prohibit students from possessing cellular telephones. Given the prevalence of cellular telephone ownership among individuals, a prohibition would effectively deny students access to these devices. I believe that students should be permitted to utilize their telephones during periods of free time, provided that they do not disrupt others and maintain the devices in vibrate mode.

However, I also believe that cellular telephone usage should be restricted during class time. Such usage would prove disruptive to the learning environment and impede student progress, as some individuals might be preoccupied with texting rather than engaging in academic pursuits. Conversely, students who choose not to bring telephones to school may lack the ability to contact their parents in the event of an emergency or require transportation. Furthermore, students should refrain from engaging in conversations on their telephones while traversing the school premises, as this behavior often results in a lack of awareness and potential collisions. It is also imperative that telephones remain deactivated during instructional periods to prevent distractions.

Policy two represents an excessively restrictive measure. This policy would only be justifiable if students consistently misused their telephones during class, disregarding all other considerations. Policy one, however, demonstrates a more reasonable approach, as it separates instructional time from periods of free time. Cellular telephones should not present a source of disruption during times of leisure, and therefore, policy one is the preferred option for these reasons.",formality,0,3,6.0

Alternatives to driving often include cycling or walking to destinations. Efforts to reduce car usage promote physical activity.

A decreased need to leave the home contributes to reduced car usage. The proliferation of the internet has facilitated communication, fostering a sense of connection and diminishing the perceived need to drive for social interaction. An individual who temporarily ceases driving may find no compelling reason to resume the practice.

first, the reasons why a person wishes to seek the most common response. someone such as a friend will usually ask more than one of his/her piers on their thoughts or opinions on something and will go on asking more people the same question. after, he/she will take all the responses they have received and will most likely go with what the majority of what their piers said. people tend to do this because they want to have an open mind about what a group of people think rather than just one person. next, why seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better choice. by asking multiple friends, piers, and even family members their thoughts on something that may or may not be important, it could help save someone from making a bad choice in the future. to conclude everything that was previously stated, asking for multiple opinions is a great way to double check if someone is making the right choice because they will have stopped them from making a choice that they could have regretted ten years from then.

second, why its good to see other people's perspective besides your own.

i know when i need someone's opinion i dont just ask one person i ask all my friends and even some of my family member's before i make a decision, and i also ask why they went with that choice to have a better understanding as to what helped them conclude to their response. by looking through someone else's perspective it could lead to a more open mind and can give a person more room to understand what other people think and why they think it . next, why its special having an open mind. having an open mind is when someone is able to take other people's opinions and instead of judging it they try to understand it. i believe people who ask for multiple opinions are very open minded and are willing to listen to other people's perspective besides their own. in conclusion, it is always important to keep an open mind when asking other people for their opinions or advice.

to conclude this entire essay, when someone is asking for advice or opinions about something they are just trying to keep an open mind are trying to make the right decision that they wont regret later in their life. so next time someone asks for an opinion don't get jealous when they walk away to ask another person the same question, remember that they are just trying to keep an open mind and they want to hear what others have to say too. ",formality,1,4,2.0
25010-CFO,"""Hey, should I wear this or this tomorrow?"" I am certain we have all had a friend request our opinions on a matter, such as what to wear on the first day of school, but have you ever considered why they seek the perspectives of others? The majority of individuals tend to request input from more than one person regarding a subject because they desire to ascertain the most prevalent response and to consider viewpoints beyond their own, maintaining an open mind.

Initially, the reasons why an individual wishes to determine the most common response should be examined. A friend, for instance, will typically request the thoughts or opinions of multiple peers on a subject and will continue to pose the same question to additional individuals. Subsequently, they will evaluate all responses received and will likely proceed with the opinion that the majority of their peers expressed. Individuals engage in this practice because they want to maintain an open perspective regarding what a group of people thinks, rather than solely relying on the opinion of one person. Furthermore, why seeking multiple opinions can facilitate a more advantageous choice needs to be considered. By requesting the thoughts of multiple friends, peers, and even family members concerning a matter that may or may not be significant, it could assist someone in avoiding a detrimental choice in the future. To summarize the aforementioned points, requesting multiple opinions represents an effective method to verify if someone is making the correct choice, potentially preventing regret in the years to come.

Secondly, the benefit of considering perspectives beyond one's own should be addressed.

I am aware that when I require an opinion, I do not simply ask one person; I request input from all of my friends and even some of my family members before making a decision. I also inquire about the reasoning behind their choice to gain a better understanding of what influenced their response. By examining a subject through another person's perspective, it can foster an open mind and provide an individual with greater insight into what others think and why they think it. Furthermore, why maintaining an open mind is advantageous must be explored. Having an open mind occurs when someone is able to accept other people's opinions and, instead of judging them, attempts to understand them. I believe individuals who request multiple opinions are generally open-minded and are willing to consider viewpoints beyond their own. In conclusion, it is consistently important to maintain an open mind when seeking the opinions or advice of others.

To conclude this essay, when someone is requesting advice or opinions regarding a matter, they are primarily attempting to maintain an open mind and to make a decision that they will not later regret. Therefore, the next time someone requests an opinion, do not feel envious when they depart to ask another person the same question; remember that they are simply striving to maintain an open mind and to hear what others have to say as well.",formality,0,4,6.0

Therefore, scientists attempted to study Venus, but they could not because they did not have any technology that could be sent to Venus. Sometimes, the consideration was to send people to Venus, but, since it was dangerous, they developed electronics made of silicon carbide and they tested it. Initially, it functioned, but it only lasted for one week. Now, they are reconsidering an older technology called mechanical computers. These devices do not utilize electronics; they were faster, more flexible, and more durable. These devices were used in the 1800s through the 1940s during World War II. Sometimes, when it is very hot, other metals melt, but these devices can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I also believe that it is worthwhile to study, even if it is dangerous, because it is fascinating and very interesting. Venus is very similar to Earth, and it would be very beneficial if we could learn more about it. The reading states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.” This means that there are many other things on other planets, no matter how dangerous it is, we should seek them out. The author focuses more on the positive aspects of Venus than the negative. Even when the author discusses unfavorable conditions, they always conclude on a positive note.

In conclusion, Venus was very similar to Earth. Scientists have attempted to study Venus for a long time, but they have not succeeded because they lack appropriate devices. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They have tried several times, but they have not succeeded. I hope that they will succeed this time, and if they do, it will provide us with a great deal of knowledge. We have already been to the Moon, so I believe they will discover how to reach Venus. Even if they cannot achieve this in our generation, I think they will achieve it in the next generation because technology continues to improve each day.",formality,0,4,6.0
3888-O,"students should design their own summer projects instead of teachers telling them how to do it. its a great way for students to be creative and be able to express how they want to. it can also teach them responsibility. summer projects are supposed to be fun for the students and when teachers tell them how to, they aren't going to want to do it.

students have creative minds. they all think and learn differently. when students are able to be creative with something they enjoy doing it. being creative is a big thing kids need in life that's how new ideas come out because people are thinking creatively. when teachers tell them how they want it done there's no room for their creativity. children need to show how creative they can be in their own way.

students have different needs, different strengths, different interests. some might like writing an essay others might like using pictures to express about their summer. everyone is different, their projects should be different also. if a student wants to make a powerpoint about their summer they should, or a student might want to write a paper about it. students should be able to do whatever they want with their projects. teachers telling them how to do it, students aren't gonna want to do it.

having a long term project like a summer project can show students how to be more responsible about it. students will learn to keep up with their things and manage their time with the project and other activities. teaching children responsibility at a young age will increase their chances of being responsible as they get older. it can also teach them how to manage time between things they need to do and things they wants to do.

students need to do their own projects without guild lines or a certain way to do it. students need to be creative and be able to express in a way their comfortable with and a way they like doing it. they also need to learn to take responsibility for their own things instead of teachers hovering over them making sure thier doing it right. teachers should sit back and let the students do their project how they want not what the teachers want. ",formality,1,4,6.0
3888-CFO,"Students should design their own summer projects rather than having teachers dictate the process. This approach provides a valuable opportunity for students to exercise creativity and express their individual preferences. Furthermore, it can cultivate a sense of responsibility. Summer projects are intended to be enjoyable for students, and teacher-imposed directives can diminish their motivation.

Students possess inherent creative capabilities and learn through diverse methods. When students are afforded the opportunity to be creative with a subject they find engaging, they are more likely to participate. Creativity is a critical attribute for children, as it fosters innovation through original thought. When teachers prescribe specific methods, the potential for student creativity is curtailed. It is imperative that children demonstrate their creative abilities in a manner that aligns with their individual approaches.

Students exhibit varied needs, strengths, and interests. Some may prefer composing essays, while others may favor utilizing visual media to convey their experiences. Given this diversity, projects should reflect these differences. If a student desires to create a PowerPoint presentation regarding their summer, they should be permitted to do so; alternatively, a student may elect to write a formal paper. Students should retain the freedom to pursue their projects as they see fit. When teachers impose rigid guidelines, student engagement is likely to decrease.

Engaging in a long-term project, such as a summer assignment, can demonstrate to students the importance of responsibility. Students will learn to maintain organization and manage their time effectively, balancing the project with other commitments. Instilling a sense of responsibility at a young age can positively influence their future conduct. It also provides valuable experience in prioritizing obligations and personal interests.

Students require the opportunity to undertake projects independently, without predetermined constraints or standardized procedures. They must be able to express themselves in a comfortable and preferred manner. Moreover, they must learn to assume responsibility for their work, rather than relying on constant teacher supervision to ensure accuracy. Educators should adopt a more passive role, allowing students to complete their projects according to their own vision, rather than adhering to teacher expectations.",formality,0,4,6.0
16199-O,"for me it's good to have a grade b average. most students would say no because that's what they like to do play sports they don't care about school or anything but most do. if you would let them play with a grade c average they would probably think they have the chance to play and still have a bad grade. they would not try hard in school. if you don't let them play when they have a grade c average and they love the sport they are playing just for the sport they will try hard at school even they might get ti up to an a. many students say they don't like any classes but they just can't wait to get to gym that's all they like to do probably for some is the only grade the have an a in. that just tells you that they will try hard in sport but not in school so if you want well any student to go to collage you might want to keep that policy. many students when they grow up want to be professional football players but i don't think any college would accept a student with all a in only sports but not in social studies, science, math and language arts. what would the student be when he grows up. what if they accept him as a professional football player and he's career is then done. he might have money but if he then want' s to work he wont have somewhere to work he was good at what he did but he is done. so if i was the principal i would keep that policy. you're students might have a better chance of being a professional football player and when hid career is done he will have another career to lean to.

also what about the parents that would be a big problem for you. they will get there report card and always see an a in sport and all c in the other classes. they will call you and say what is going on with my kid. all you will sat is that the policy is to still play sport even if they have a c but is the students problem if he doesn't have an a in his classes. before you know the kid will be in another school with all a and you with one less kid in you're school. you might want to keep all you're students. what if when you're student grow up to be someone important the will probably grow up to be someone important and they tell the whole world and you will be honored who knows. you probably get my point to not change the policy because you probably don't care what happens but you will be proud to know you made good students. you made them grow up to be successful students with all good grades. you will make the student work hard to even get a b and then play sport. you will make them work hard but at the same time they will get to play what they love the most. so you better keep the b aver",formality,1,4,2.0
16199-CFO,"For many individuals, maintaining a grade of B is considered an acceptable academic standing. It is common for students to express a preference against this, often prioritizing extracurricular activities such as sports over scholastic pursuits. While a significant number of students may exhibit this inclination, it is important to acknowledge that some may be willing to compromise their academic performance to participate in athletics, potentially diminishing their effort in their studies. Conversely, upholding a policy that restricts athletic participation for students with a grade of C may motivate them to strive for improved academic standing, even potentially achieving a grade of A.

Many students profess a lack of enthusiasm for their academic coursework, yet eagerly anticipate physical education classes, demonstrating a strong affinity for sports. For some, this may represent their sole area of academic success. This observation suggests that students may dedicate considerable effort toward athletic endeavors while neglecting their academic responsibilities. Therefore, to ensure the future collegiate prospects of students, it is advisable to retain the existing policy.

The ambition of becoming a professional athlete is a common aspiration among students; however, it is unlikely that any institution of higher education would admit a student with exclusively high grades in athletics but lacking proficiency in core subjects such as social studies, science, mathematics, and language arts. The potential consequences for such a student are considerable. Should they be accepted into a professional athletic career, their career’s termination could leave them ill-equipped for alternative employment opportunities, despite their athletic success.

If I were in a position of administrative leadership, I would maintain the current policy. This approach would provide students with a greater likelihood of achieving a professional athletic career while also equipping them with the skills necessary for a subsequent career.

Furthermore, parental concerns would be a significant factor. Parents receiving report cards displaying an A in athletics and Cs in other subjects would likely initiate inquiries regarding their child's academic performance. The appropriate response would be to reiterate the policy, emphasizing that the student’s academic responsibility remains with the student. Failure to address this could result in the student transferring to another school, thereby diminishing the school’s student population. Retaining students offers the potential for future recognition and pride.

It is possible that a student could grow to become a significant figure, and their success would be attributed to the school’s policies. The school would be recognized for fostering successful students. Maintaining the policy would compel students to exert considerable effort to achieve a B average and participate in athletics, thereby encouraging diligence while allowing them to pursue their passion. Therefore, it is imperative that the policy remains unchanged.",formality,0,4,6.0

community service or not?!?!

i strongly agree, that our principle teacher_name should perform community service. all students need to take a little time out of your schedules and help the earth. not just students every one who lives on this planet can join and help. he is not asking a lot, speaking for myself,

i will take a stand and do community service. just think about the oil spill that just happened.

when i was one day watching the news something caught my eyes. there has been an terrible oil spill, in the oceans. just think about how all the animals felt, when the fish were swimming they were eating and breathing the oil. over 1,000 of animals have died because of this. some people just don't under stand they can make a huge difference, just walk along the beach one day just look at all the litter that is around.

people just take advantage , of the situation and just throw there litter on the floor not caring and thinking of what could happen. ""think before you do people.""

all that stuff can get washed up on the shore, a jelly fish might mistaken it for a nice little snack or any fish in the water. we all have the chance to make a difference in are world to make are world an better place. some are just to lazy to do it, i understand on the other behave, will i didn't do it. just think of if your house was getting robbed and the police said well we didn't do it so there is nothing we can do about it! how would that make you feel? what if obama the president of untied states of america said well i didn't create all the problems invoking the taxes, and health care, this problems were already here when i got here. you just have to just think of the cost and effect.

i know we are all not perfect but that is no excuse, just take 5 minutes to help out. maybe just picking up one piece of paper can make a difference. people take life for granted only when they are in trouble or when there kids or something are in trouble they wasn't to bring community service. don't be selfish being selfish is not going to get you anywhere in life. no offense to the school's i went to in the past, but only two of the schools that i was involved with exactly did community service was, school_name

Community Service: A Necessary Action

I firmly believe that our principal, Teacher Name, should implement a community service program. All students should dedicate a portion of their time to assisting the environment. This is not limited to students; every individual residing on this planet has the capacity to participate and contribute. The request is not extensive; speaking from my own perspective, I will advocate for and engage in community service. Consider the recent oil spill as a pertinent example.

During a routine news broadcast, a distressing event captured my attention: a severe oil spill had occurred in the oceans. Imagine the distress experienced by the affected wildlife; as fish swam, they ingested and breathed in the oil. Over one thousand animals have perished as a consequence of this incident. Some individuals fail to comprehend the significant impact they can have; a simple walk along a beach reveals the pervasive litter that accumulates. 

Certain individuals exploit the situation, discarding refuse without regard for the potential ramifications. The admonition, ""Consider the consequences of your actions,"" is particularly relevant. 

This discarded material can be carried by currents and deposited on shorelines, where marine organisms may mistake it for sustenance. Each of us possesses the opportunity to positively influence our world and enhance its condition. Some individuals are reluctant to participate, and while I understand this perspective, I choose to act. Imagine if law enforcement responded to a home robbery with the assertion that no action could be taken, citing a lack of responsibility. How would that engender a sense of security? Similarly, if President Obama stated that the issues surrounding taxation and healthcare were pre-existing conditions, absolving him of responsibility, the implications would be detrimental. A thorough assessment of cause and effect is essential.

While acknowledging that perfection is unattainable, this does not constitute a justification for inaction. Dedicating even five minutes to assist can prove beneficial. The removal of a single piece of litter can contribute to a positive change. Individuals often disregard the value of life until confronted with adversity or when their children are in peril, at which point they desire community involvement. Selfishness will not lead to success. With respect to the institutions I have attended, only two, School Name Loop Program and School Name, actively engaged in community service. 

During these programs, we collected litter around the school and at Garfield Park. While we recognized that our actions might not fundamentally alter the world, we understood that we had performed a worthwhile endeavor and fulfilled our obligation to protect the environment. Collective effort and collaboration enable us to achieve any objective we set our minds to. “Create change,” “make a difference!”",formality,0,4,2.0

imagine you're driving down the highway, listening to your favorite song, and you check your phone to see if anyone has texted you back, and all of a sudden your face is on the steering wheel. you've just crashed. now your car is wrecked and you're owing thousands of dollars to the person you've hit in front of you, all because you checked your phone. there is really only one reasonable excuse for you to use your phone while driving, which is using it for gps. but in all actuality, there should be no use of your cell phone while you're in the driver's seat, not only do you put your own life danger, but also to those who are around you, sharing the same road as you. there are many other probable causes to not use your phone while driving.

for instance, your family could be with you in the car and if you were to make the simple mistake of sending one text message, that one message could end all that. even something as simple as picking up the phone is dangerous. using your phone while driving raises your risk of having an accident by 400% as it states on carsguide. com (25 - 26 ).

more evidence from this same site states ""in the us, the national highway traffic safety administration estimated that nearly 3500 people died in distraction-related crashes in 2015"" (20 - 21). if you still choose to use your phone, it only takes a couple seconds to simply pull over somewhere and answer your text or call.

the only instance where someone may be allowed to use the phone, is for gps use. the only people i can see doing that is someone going on a long trip, someone visiting from somewhere else, or an uber/lyft driver . sometimes that's how those people make their money, evidence of this on ride. guru states "" according to another study fron 2015, uber drivers in atlanta make $39,929 usd per year before expenses "".

1054-CFO,"Phone Usage and Vehicle Operation

Imagine one is operating a vehicle along a highway, enjoying a preferred musical selection, and briefly consulting a mobile telephone to ascertain the status of a communication, and subsequently experiencing unintended contact with the steering wheel. A collision has occurred. The vehicle is now damaged, and significant financial obligations are incurred due to the impact with a vehicle positioned ahead, all resulting from a momentary engagement with the mobile telephone. There exists a limited justification for the utilization of a mobile telephone while operating a vehicle, specifically for the purpose of accessing navigational guidance systems. However, in actuality, the use of a cellular telephone should be prohibited during periods of vehicle operation, as it presents a danger not only to the operator but also to those sharing the roadway. Numerous compelling reasons support the avoidance of mobile telephone usage while driving.

For example, family members may be present within the vehicle, and a seemingly minor action, such as transmitting a single text message, could result in devastating consequences. Even the simple act of retrieving the telephone from a secure location poses a significant hazard. Research indicates that mobile telephone usage while driving elevates the risk of an accident by 400 percent, as detailed on carsguide.com.au (25-26).

Further evidence from this same source states, ""in the united states, the national highway traffic safety administration estimated that nearly 3500 individuals perished in accidents attributable to distraction in 2015"" (20-21). Should one choose to engage with a mobile telephone, a brief cessation of travel, allowing for a safe location to respond to a communication, is a prudent alternative.

A permissible instance for mobile telephone utilization may be restricted to navigational purposes. Such usage would be reasonably expected from individuals embarking on extended journeys, visitors unfamiliar with the area, or those engaged in providing transportation services via platforms like Uber or Lyft. For some, this represents a source of income, as evidenced by ride.guru, which states, ""according to another study from 2015, uber drivers in atlanta generate $39,929 usd annually before accounting for expenses.""

It is evident that the practice of mobile telephone usage during vehicle operation should be discontinued to safeguard one’s life, the lives of passengers, pedestrians, other drivers, and all individuals sharing the roadway.

21949-O,"online schooling or video conference? i support this way of learning for students, who feel the need to stay home or not getting to school and deaing with distractions that can stop them from learning. staying home and learning sounds amazing because you wouldn't have to get up, get dressed, or worry about other students at school and their drama.

learning at home sounds like a comfortable learning environment. some students take this opportunity because either they were pregnant,moving a lot, or have anxiety that makes it hard to communicate with other peers and teachers at school. for me being in school is not a good idea i wish that i was able to take online school or at least a video conference with a teacher. having anxiety makes it hard for me to learn at school because in class i always feel like people are always judging me or talking about me because i didn't do the homework or i got an answer wrong. socializing with other people i don't know triggers my anxiety and makes me feel some type of way that doesn't make me want to come to school. the reason i have never brought this up to my parents about putting me into online school is because i have supporting friends and its my last year of high school and i know i can do this and other students.

i noticed that distractions can also prevent students from learning. distractions are everywhere,but at school theres way more. students drama is the worst thing ever because rumors and gossip can really effect a students learning environment. in my sophomore year of high school my friend who was also a sophomore. one day in class we got a new student who came from another school, so my teacher made my friend show him around the school and everything so he could feel welcomed to this school. after a couple of days these group of girls came up to my friend and the new student and started to say really awful things about her, she went crying home. few days later she texted me saying that she will be doing online school to stay away from distractions and get her school stuff together. from this experience that happened to my friend i think that was the best option.

when the teacher is teaching in a big class it is sometimes very hard to understand most of the time. having a video conference with a teacher and learning one on one can really benefit from you learning. with these reasons,explanation,and experience i very much think for some students this option would be a really good idea.            ",formality,1,4,6.0
21949-CFO,"Online schooling or video conferencing represents a beneficial learning modality for students who experience challenges attending traditional schooling due to extenuating circumstances or detrimental distractions. The prospect of learning from home presents an attractive alternative, eliminating the need for daily routines such as rising, dressing, and navigating the social dynamics inherent in a school environment.

The opportunity to learn at home is often embraced by students facing unique situations, such as pregnancy, frequent relocation, or debilitating anxiety that hinders effective communication with peers and instructors. Personally, the conventional school setting proves problematic; I would prefer the option of online schooling or, at a minimum, a video conference with an instructor. The presence of anxiety significantly impedes my ability to learn in a classroom setting, as I frequently experience feelings of judgment or scrutiny regarding academic performance. Social interaction with unfamiliar individuals exacerbates this anxiety, diminishing my desire to attend school. The reluctance to discuss this preference with my parents stems from the support of my friends and the recognition that I, along with other students, am capable of succeeding in this alternative learning environment, particularly as I approach the culmination of my high school education.

Distractions also demonstrably impede student learning, and these are often more prevalent in a school environment. Student-related drama, particularly the propagation of rumors and gossip, can negatively impact the learning atmosphere. During my sophomore year, a classmate and fellow sophomore was tasked with assisting a newly enrolled student. Subsequently, a group of female students subjected her to hurtful remarks, causing her to leave school in tears. Shortly thereafter, she elected to pursue online schooling to mitigate distractions and focus on her academic responsibilities. This experience reinforces my belief that online schooling represents an advantageous solution.

Furthermore, comprehension can be challenging within large classroom settings. A video conference with an instructor, facilitating a more individualized learning experience, can prove beneficial. Considering these justifications, explanations, and personal experiences, I firmly believe that this alternative learning modality would be a valuable option for certain students.",formality,0,4,6.0
24998-O,"so scientist's have researched and discovered that when someone is making a hard choice, people often ask others about their opinions. therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.

secondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. for example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. so then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.

furthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. so some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.

lastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, i would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. then other times when it's not such a major decison then i would maybe ask your friends. so just remeber the next time your making a big or small decision maybe ask your friends for their opinions first then make the decision.",formality,1,4,2.0
24998-CFO,"Scientific investigations have revealed that individuals frequently seek counsel from others when confronted with difficult choices. These studies indicate that incorporating external perspectives often leads to a more informed decision. The acquisition of diverse opinions expands an individual’s understanding of the potential outcomes associated with a particular choice. It is crucial to consider the viewpoints offered without immediate rejection, demonstrating respectful engagement with the advice provided.

Furthermore, while encouragement to make a choice can be detrimental, the provision of opinions can be beneficial. This approach allows an individual to discern their preferences and dislikes. For instance, a job seeker might inquire of friends who have experience at prospective employers. This information can then be used to conduct further research, allowing for a more prepared and realistic expectation of the role.

Moreover, the appropriateness of seeking counsel varies depending on the situation. For example, requesting a friend’s opinion regarding an event they do not enjoy may not be advisable. In such instances, independent decision-making is necessary. There are occasions when soliciting external viewpoints is not practical.

Finally, when facing significant life decisions, reliance on personal intuition is often preferable to seeking the opinions of others. Conversely, for less consequential choices, the input of friends can be valuable. Therefore, it is recommended that individuals consider the perspectives of others before making decisions, regardless of their magnitude.",formality,0,4,4.0
6241-O,"what would happen if your principal made a new rule where you have to go to an after school activity let me tell you what i think. on a personal scale i don't go to many after school activities. once school is over i like to just get on the bus, go home and be done with school for the rest of the day. if the principle made a new rule where everybody had to do an after school activity i would strongly disagree. the reasons for this would be that some kids such as myself are tired of school and don't want to hang around. another reason may be that they may have a sibling in a nearby elementary school that gets home later than them, but no parents are home so they have to be. the last reason is nothing may really stick out to some people.

someday you just have had a long extra boring day and want to be done with it. if you do, i would agree that most after school activities are fun ways to waste time and keep you at school. i don't think that they should be enforced to go to them because people aren't always in the mood and just want to get home to relax, do there homework, and watch the simpsons or play video games. kids should'nt be force to do thing they don't like, even though that's exactly what school is. kids need time to relax and do something on there own time and after school activities are not that.

if you have a younger sibling and both your parents work then you know what it's like. having to go home right after school to make sure that they get there safe and then watching them till your parents get home. i feel that lots of kids have this problem or situation i should say. these are the type of people who don't have the time needed to g to any sort or type of after school activities. my question for the principal would be what would he do with these kids make them come and do them over the weekend have the parents hire a expensive babysitter. i'll tell you what he'll do absolutely nothing. he can't barge his way into a family plan like that just because he wants kids to stay at school longer. thats a stupid reason, to change a families whole system over something so small like that. if i was ever a kid in a situation like this i still would not go, because their family system family is more important than a principals wish to waste kids's time.

the last reason i disagree with this is what if a kid who has all the time in the world has an older sibling or a guardian of some sort at home for a younger sibling. they look over all of the choices and stare just stare at them all because theres nothing there that fits there personality, then what do they do? i'll tell you what they'll do they don't go to any of the after school activities because thee nothing that they like what's the point it'll just seem like school but longer. i know what people would say ""oh, but they may just find a hidden talent they never knew they had"". no, ive gone to a variety of after school activities and not ne new thing i've tried i stuck with, shocker. what percentage of kids actually find a ""hidden talent"" probably like 26%. the point i'm trying to make here is that even if nothing sticks out you can still go and try to find that "" hidden talent"" but to me that's just a bunch of baloney.

in the long run an in many people an after school activity is a chance to spread your wings and grow, but to me they suck i hate them. if your principal ever makes a rule like this where you have to go to any after school activity then start a petition get fifth teen pages worth of signatures show it to him. tell him why you did what you did show him whos the real boss is by over throwing him, destroying the school and getting rid of that stupid new rule. i just really hate after school activities and all they don't have to offer.",formality,1,4,1.0
6241-CFO,"What would occur if the principal instituted a regulation requiring participation in after-school activities? Allow me to present my perspective. On a personal level, I do not frequently engage in after-school activities. Once the school day concludes, I prefer to board the bus, return home, and conclude my school commitments for the remainder of the day. Were the principal to enact a regulation mandating participation in after-school activities for all students, I would express strong disagreement. The reasons for this opposition are multifaceted.

Firstly, some students, including myself, experience exhaustion following the school day and desire respite from academic engagement. A second consideration involves familial responsibilities. Certain students may be obligated to return home to care for younger siblings due to parental work schedules and a lack of immediate parental availability. The final reason pertains to the simple fact that certain activities may not appeal to some individuals.

There are occasions when a student endures an extended and particularly tedious school day and simply desires its conclusion. In such circumstances, I would contend that many after-school activities represent unproductive uses of time, keeping students unnecessarily at the school premises. It is inappropriate to compel students to participate in activities they do not desire, despite the inherent obligations of the educational system. Students require opportunities for relaxation and independent pursuits, and mandated after-school activities do not fulfill this requirement.

Consider the situation of a student responsible for the well-being of a younger sibling while parents are employed. This obligation necessitates an immediate return home to ensure the sibling’s safety and subsequent supervision until parental return. Many students encounter this circumstance. Such individuals lack the time necessary to participate in after-school programs. The appropriate inquiry for the principal would be to ascertain his proposed course of action regarding these students – would they be compelled to attend such activities on weekends, or would parents be obligated to secure costly childcare? The reality is that the principal would likely take no action; he cannot arbitrarily impose his will upon established family arrangements due to a desire to extend the school day. Such a justification would be unreasonable. If I were in such a situation, I would still decline to participate, prioritizing familial responsibilities over the principal’s preference for prolonging the school day.

Furthermore, consider the student who possesses ample free time but lacks interest in the available after-school options. They may scrutinize the choices, finding none that align with their interests. In such instances, the student would decline participation, as the extended duration of school offers no discernible benefit. Individuals might suggest that the student may discover a previously unknown talent. However, based on my experience, attempts to engage in various activities have yielded no lasting interests. The percentage of students who genuinely discover a “hidden talent” is likely minimal. While experimentation is permissible, the prospect of finding such a talent appears improbable.

Ultimately, after-school activities are often presented as opportunities for personal growth. However, I find them objectionable. Should a principal enact such a rule, students should initiate a petition, collecting a substantial number of signatures to present to the principal. The petition should articulate the reasons for opposition and demonstrate the students' collective voice, effectively challenging the principal’s authority and abolishing the regulation. I simply find after-school activities unappealing and lacking in value.",formality,0,4,6.0
5913-O,"hi, my name is generic_name. i go to generic_school. are principal generic_name, decided that all the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. i think generic_name is very wrong ,and i strongly disagree with his choice. he should of made the students vote first. weather if they want to do that or not. i have a lot of reasons why generic_name shouldnt of done that.

so like i already said, i disagree with generic_name's choice. here is why i disagree. my first reason is that not all the students have time during school or after school for these class's. they already have like 5 other class's, and almost all the class's have homework. when will the students get time to do the homework they have from their original class,s. they may finish the homework, but the students don't have as many breaks during the day as they had. those extracurricular activities aren't gonna make the students better at school or smarter. so they kind of don't have a good reason to give them to us. thats why i think generic_name should let the students vote cause i would vote no cause i disagree, and i don't like the idea.

more reasons are that some of these extracurricular actives are after school, and a lot of the parents work. which means you would not have a ride back home. most of the students don't like school. for example you have me i hate going to school. i count the hours, but thats ok. whats not ok is when i have to go to school after school. that just to me is not fair. cause thats like my whole day gone in school, and thats not my opinion alone a lot of other people have that opinion too.

this is the most important reason to me and everyone on this earth. when will the students have time to relax, and sit down alone to do the things and the hobbies they love. if they do those extracurricular activities they won't have the time to do any of this stuff. the good mind is in the good body. if the students don't take care of them selves. they can get depressed or get the corona virus and die. i would not like any of that to happen to me or any one in this world. school work is hard, and more work equals stress, and stress equals high blood pressure, and thats not good for children. thats why i disagree.

another reason is that all this work, stress, and time will take you away from the stuff you love doing. you won't see your friends as often. you won't get time to do your hobbies or talents. you won't see your parents if they go to work late in the day, and come in the morning. you will have to work on weekends and on holidays that would suck. that is why i disagree with generic_name.

i think generic_name should think this threw again. he should ask some of his coworkers, and teachers. he should have a pole or a survey. because if a lot of people disagree like me they don't have to do the extracurricular activities. or he can ask the kids what activity they like, and then he can have class's the students would like. for example i like cooking if he would have a cooking class. i would do the extracurricular activity. maybe not every day but that is something i enjoy doing at home. maybe i would enjoy it at school who knows. all i know now is that i disagree with the class's that generic_name has now and the timing. thats why i disagree.

5913-CFO,"My name is Generic Name, and I am a student at Generic School. Principal Generic Name has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe Principal Generic Name is mistaken, and I strongly disagree with his decision. He should have allowed the students to vote beforehand to determine if they desired such a requirement.

I express my disagreement with Principal Generic Name’s decision for several reasons. Initially, not all students possess sufficient time, either during the school day or after school, to accommodate these activities. Students are already enrolled in multiple courses, and these courses frequently involve substantial homework assignments. It is unclear when students will find the time to complete the homework assigned in their regular classes. Furthermore, extracurricular activities are unlikely to enhance students' academic performance or intelligence. Therefore, there is little justification for mandating their participation. I would vote against such a requirement, as I find the idea objectionable.

Additionally, some extracurricular activities are scheduled after school hours, which presents a logistical challenge for students whose parents are employed. Consequently, students may lack transportation home. Many students already find school to be an unpleasant experience. For instance, I personally dislike attending school and frequently monitor the time remaining in the day. It is particularly burdensome when students are required to attend school after school hours, which I consider unfair. This is a common sentiment shared by numerous individuals.

A paramount concern is the lack of time for students to relax and pursue their personal interests and hobbies. Participation in extracurricular activities will preclude these opportunities. A healthy mind is fostered by a healthy body. Neglecting self-care can lead to depression or illness. I would be distressed if such outcomes were to occur to myself or any individual. Academic responsibilities are demanding, and increased workload contributes to stress, which can elevate blood pressure—a detrimental effect on children. Therefore, I maintain my disagreement.

Moreover, the demands of this increased workload will diminish opportunities to engage in enjoyable activities. Students will have less frequent interaction with friends, reduced time for hobbies and talents, and diminished opportunities to spend time with parents who work late hours. Weekend and holiday time will be consumed by these obligations, which is undesirable. I therefore disagree with Principal Generic Name’s directive.

I believe Principal Generic Name should reconsider his decision. He should consult with his colleagues and educators. He should conduct a poll or survey. If a significant number of individuals, such as myself, express disagreement, the requirement for extracurricular activities could be waived. Alternatively, he could solicit student preferences regarding activities, thereby creating classes that students would find appealing. For example, I enjoy cooking, and if a cooking class were offered, I would participate in the extracurricular activity. While I am uncertain about the specifics, I currently disagree with the classes and scheduling that Principal Generic Name has implemented.",formality,0,4,1.0

in the story "" driverless cars are coming"" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. one being general motors, whose idea was towards ""smart roads"". having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. if we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? basing all of our driving on a ""smart road"" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late.

okay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. what about smart cars? google came out with a toyota prius. the prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a gps receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. sounds cool right? there are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. the first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. the last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof.

so, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. still can not make up your mind? take the human mind as a consideration. these smart cars would make humans lazy. if we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. in the story ""driverless cars are coming"" paragraph eight reads "" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? no, you wpould not. the little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right.

in conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. as people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us. in ""driverless cars are coming"", the author states both good and bad ideas of the driverless cars, i encourge you to think about the little things and the bad thing, on why we should not allow driverless cars.

Increasingly, individuals are choosing to ride in driverless or semi-driverless vehicles. However, without a driver’s visual attention on the road, how can driverless vehicles be considered safe? The author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" presents examples demonstrating how driverless cars can lead to delays, increased expenses, and a higher incidence of accidents.

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" paragraph three details numerous companies that have begun manufacturing driverless vehicles. General Motors, for instance, proposed the concept of ""smart roads."" The implementation of smart roads would be impractical due to the substantial costs associated with magnets and specialized car sensors. Should the road infrastructure experience a malfunction, what recourse would be available? Basing all vehicular operation on a ""smart road"" system would elevate the risk of infrastructure failure and subsequent delays.

Now, if smart roads are undesirable, what about smart vehicles? Google developed a Toyota Prius. The Prius utilizes position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. This may appear advantageous; however, there are several issues with incorporating such extensive technology into a vehicle. The initial concern is that the failure of any single component would result in significant repair expenses. Secondly, a malfunction of any system would render the vehicle inoperable. Finally, the added weight of all these gadgets would negatively impact fuel efficiency.

Therefore, smart roads and smart vehicles appear to be problematic. Still unable to form an opinion? Consider the human mind. These automated vehicles would foster human complacency. With driverless cars, individuals would not actively monitor the surrounding environment. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" paragraph eight notes that “some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment.” Imagine the consequences if a vehicle experienced a malfunction; would the occupants of the driverless car remain attentive? Consider the scenario of a child unexpectedly running into the street after a ball; would the vehicle or a human driver be aware? Moreover, contemplate the monotony that would pervade the world if individuals were merely passengers, not drivers. Would one observe the expansive blue sky or the captivating beauty of a forest? No, one would not. The seemingly minor details are what transform driving into a privilege, not a right.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a viable option. As individuals, we must consistently anticipate the conditions ahead. In “Driverless Cars Are Coming,” the author presents both advantageous and disadvantageous aspects of driverless cars.

two of the many advantages of limiting car usage is it eliminates stress and lowers air pollution. being stressed is very unhealthy and a simple way to limit your stress is by limiting car usage. a media trainer named heidrun walter stated, ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way(source 1)."" if having a car is stressful, then ride a bike, or take a bus that still takes you from point a to b, just like a car does. car usage is bad for our planet when it comes to air polution.

saving money and reducing traffic are other advantages of limiting car usage. traffic is always a problem when trying to get where you need to go.

However, rather than procuring a new automobile, consideration should be given to acquiring a stylish bicycle. Numerous individuals utilize automobiles for transportation to work, errands, and school; however, the extent of automobile usage significantly impacts both the environment and personal well-being. Reducing reliance on automobiles presents an effective means of mitigating stress, lowering air pollution, decreasing traffic congestion, and conserving financial resources, thereby contributing to a healthier and more sustainable world.

Two significant benefits of minimizing automobile usage are the reduction of stress and the decrease in air pollution. Experiencing stress is detrimental to health, and a straightforward method of minimizing stress involves limiting automobile usage. According to media trainer Heidrun Walter, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (source 1). Consequently, utilizing a bicycle or public transportation, which provide comparable transportation from one location to another, is a viable alternative. Automobile usage contributes to environmental degradation through air pollution. ""...passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (source 1). Consequently, exploring alternatives to automobile transportation would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Limiting automobile usage promotes a more content and healthier lifestyle.

The prevalence of individuals rushing to work in the morning often results in vehicles progressing only a few feet per minute due to traffic backups. However, with a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, this issue would be eliminated. Financial conservation is consistently advantageous, particularly within the current economic climate, and this can be achieved through limiting automobile usage. ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (source 4). This decrease is attributable to factors such as individuals’ inability to afford new vehicles and the unemployment rate (source 4). Sharing rides with friends is a practical method of conserving money and reducing traffic.

Automobile usage represents a significant challenge within contemporary society. The advantages of limiting automobile usage—namely, mitigating stress, lowering air pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and conserving financial resources—will contribute to a healthier and more sustainable world.

To begin, there are locations where cars are absent, and life continues without issue, and individuals experience reduced stress. For example, the streets of Vauban are entirely “car free.” Heidrum Walter states, “When I had a car, I was consistently tense. I am considerably happier this way.” (source 1). Living without a car is not detrimental. Living without a car can be advantageous for us. However, despite the fact that living without a car can be an advantage, not everyone agrees. After several days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of France, following five days of intensifying smog. Paris typically experiences more smog than other European capitals. Delivery companies reported lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and vehicles carrying three or more passengers. (source 2). If delivery companies and my fellow citizens could realize that the cars we center our development on are polluting our air, causing smog in certain areas of the world, it is evident because Paris banned certain cars, and the smog subsequently diminished. Therefore, instead of driving our cars everywhere, we can utilize this to our advantage and limit our car usage, so we can prevent smog in our community and pollution in the atmosphere.

In addition, going car-less provides a stress-free environment. Business Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” which is absolutely true in my view. In Bogota, Colombia, a program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. (source 3). The car-free day in Bogota, and how people walked, biked, and skated, demonstrates a beneficial way to reduce stress. While either walking, biking, or engaging in similar activities, one has the opportunity to clear their mind and simultaneously avoid polluting the air, which cannot result in smog. Furthermore, going car-free is also becoming a new trend; a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

24648-O,"reasons why you should ask for advice are so you dont make anyone mad, get the job thats good and fits you well and so it dousnt knock you down and ruin your life. you don't want to mess up you future so ask for help and choose wisely. never do something so suddenly without thinking because you might hurt yourself physically or mentally or other always think beofre acting.

people should ask for multiple opinions because often their sudden choices could come back to haunt them later in life. for example someone could decide to get a tattoo but they didnt ask people how it could effect them or if it was a good idea or not, then later they cant get the job they want. later in life they might regret it or start disliking the tattoo or the decision that they made that they didnt get multiple opinions on. because as you get older your mind set will change and the people around you will change, not everyone thinks the same though, some people might think an idea is good but a couple think its bad. if it is the idea is health hazardous then it could come back and might make you have health problems and maybe even die earlier. so the point is to always ask for advice so it doesnt come back later to ruin your life.

not getting multiple opinions could make your family mad at you for not asking them and getting their opinion on why they think its good or bad. they might hate what the idea was and since they were not asked or told about it they feel betrayed. but if you asked for advice or help they might help you make a better decision for yourself. everyone wants to make the right decision but if you need a little help sometimes ask someone who already does the thing you want to do, or ask your family what would be best for yourself. if you dont ask you could make the wrong decision and and end up needing your family for help later and living with your parents. so you never want it to fail that bad so if your hesitating to do something ask someone should i do this and why? always ask people for advice and help because if you dont it could ruin your life.

another reason you should ask for advice to make a better decision is so you can get more informed on the topic. people that have done the job before can teach you and tell you tips and tricks, that is good because you might be good and some of the things youll have to do. knowing the job is everything so if you can find out all the helpful tips you'll be good. they can also tell you what there favorite part of the job was and what they had to do a lot. that can be helpful because if you love working outside and on the job for example you have to work outside a lot maybe you should consider it. they can also tell u what they had to do a lot that they hated that can help because if you hate something that you have to do for work you're not going to want to do it and maybe you should consider something else. most people want to have a job they like not a job they like part of but most of the time hate their job. so you should always asked a experienced person that has done what you want to do and ask for there advice if you should apply for the job or not.

in all i think people should ask for advice and at least 3 people before making a decision so it doesn't come back to knock you down and slow life down for you, so no one will get mad over the decision your making and ask a professional before saying yes or no to see if the job will be good for you. because we all want the best for eachother if someone does ask you for advice tell them what you think and how you feel because later you might need to ask them for advice. that is why you should always ask for more then 1 person for advice and ask for advice or help in general.",formality,1,4,6.0
24648-CFO,"Reasons why individuals should solicit advice are to avoid causing offense, secure a suitable and fulfilling employment opportunity, and to prevent adverse consequences that could negatively impact one’s life. It is prudent to avoid errors that could compromise one’s future; therefore, seeking assistance and exercising careful consideration are essential. Impulsive actions, undertaken without due deliberation, can result in physical or psychological harm, or affect others.

Individuals should obtain multiple perspectives, as hasty decisions can have repercussions later in life. For instance, a person might elect to obtain a tattoo without consulting others regarding potential effects or advisability. Subsequently, they may encounter difficulty securing desired employment or experience regret concerning the decision. As individuals mature, their perspectives and the perspectives of those around them will evolve; not everyone will share the same viewpoint. An idea deemed favorable by some may be considered detrimental by others. If an idea poses a health hazard, it could lead to medical complications and a reduced lifespan. Therefore, it is advisable to consistently seek counsel to mitigate potential future adversity.

Failure to solicit multiple opinions could engender resentment from family members who feel their input was disregarded. They may disapprove of a decision made without their consultation, leading to feelings of betrayal. Conversely, seeking advice may facilitate a more informed and beneficial decision. Individuals often desire to make sound choices; therefore, seeking guidance from those with experience in a desired field or consulting family members can prove invaluable. Failure to do so could lead to regrettable decisions and a reliance on family support. It is essential to avoid such outcomes; therefore, when faced with uncertainty, it is prudent to inquire, “Should I pursue this course of action, and why?” Consistent solicitation of advice is vital to safeguarding one’s future.

Another rationale for seeking counsel is to enhance one’s understanding of a particular subject. Individuals with prior experience can impart valuable knowledge and techniques. This is advantageous, as it may improve one’s proficiency in specific tasks. Comprehensive knowledge of a profession is paramount; therefore, obtaining insights from experienced individuals can be highly beneficial. They can also articulate their preferred aspects of the role and the tasks they performed frequently. This information can be instrumental in determining whether a particular career aligns with one’s interests. Many individuals aspire to find satisfaction in their work; however, they often experience dissatisfaction in their current employment. Therefore, consulting with an experienced professional and soliciting their advice regarding a potential career change is highly recommended.

In conclusion, individuals should seek advice from at least three people before making a decision to prevent negative consequences and avoid causing offense. Consulting with a professional is advisable before accepting or rejecting a job offer to ensure it is a suitable fit. It is universally desired that individuals prosper, and offering advice to others demonstrates a commitment to their well-being, as reciprocity may be required in the future. Therefore, consistently seeking diverse perspectives and soliciting guidance is essential for making informed decisions and navigating life’s challenges.",formality,0,4,6.0

Contemporary society is significantly impacted by technological advancements. Nearly every individual possesses some form of technology, such as a cellular phone or computer. Individuals have become so reliant on these devices that they are even willing to jeopardize their safety and the safety of others. This discussion concerns cellular phone usage while operating a vehicle. The utilization of cellular phones while driving should be prohibited due to the safety risks it poses to the driver and any passengers involved, and because it presents a comparable danger to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

Initially, drivers should not be permitted to utilize cellular phones within a vehicle, as this presents a substantial safety hazard. Is risking one’s life for a brief text message truly justifiable? Research indicates that numerous deaths and injuries on roadways are attributable to distracted drivers. These distractions frequently involve simple text messages and notifications that could be addressed at a later time. It is preferable to respond belatedly than not at all.

Furthermore, the prohibition of cellular phone usage while driving is warranted due to the parallels it shares with driving under the influence. Both distracted and intoxicated drivers exhibit a deficiency in the mental acuity required to safely manage a vehicle. Both of these behaviors have become widespread issues in the current era, with some sources even asserting that distracted driving is more perilous. A Fox News 13 study revealed that drivers who text while operating a vehicle are eight times more likely to be involved in a collision than those who are driving under the influence of alcohol.

In conclusion, the utilization of cellular phones while driving is demonstrably hazardous and represents a degree of recklessness.

yes technology has come a long way the past few years and for the most part it has made positive impacts on our day-to-day lives but we cant just forget the downsides of all these new tech gadgets. think about how easy it is for someone to hack into your laptop or phone and get all of your person information. how long do you think it would take skilled hackers to find a way to get control of your self driving car once they are released, 6 months maybe a year and you could have thousands of peole trying to gain full power over your vehicle and they just might be able to.

lets also not forget that computers and other devices malfunction quite often, more frequently then we'd like to admit. have you ever been on your laptop while constructing an important document and your system just completely shut down without saving? that has happened to me and many people i know and we all thought it was one of the worst things that could happen. can you imagine what would happen if you're on the middle of the expressway taking a nice road trip with your family and your car just shuts off in the middle of the highway surrounded by 10 ton trucks that could crush your small self driven car like it was an empty soda can. i can risk losing papers on my hard drive due to a malfunction, but im not willing to risk my life to one.

sure everyone has dreamed of a self driving machine but now that you know all the things that could inevedably go wrong, does it really seem like that cool of an idea? lets say you can afford a car that drives it self, can you afford the damage you could be held responsible for if something goes wrong with the vehicle. can you afford to maintain and repair a 2 ton computer that has enough technology to drive you around? i hope that the facts i have told you today will help clear up and questions you've had about if its worth it or not because when you really think about it, it's truely not.

However, a critical question arises: can one genuinely place trust in a computerized system with the safety of one’s companions and family?

Indeed, technology has advanced considerably in recent years, and generally it has produced positive influences on daily routines. Nevertheless, it is imperative not to disregard the potential drawbacks associated with these novel technological devices. Consider the relative ease with which an individual may compromise a laptop or mobile telephone and procure personal information. It is reasonable to speculate on the timeframe required for proficient hackers to discover a method of gaining control over a self-driving vehicle once they are introduced; perhaps within six months to a year, and potentially with thousands of individuals attempting to exert complete authority over a vehicle, a possibility that cannot be dismissed.

Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge that computers and other electronic devices are susceptible to malfunctions, often with greater frequency than is desirable. Has one ever been utilizing a laptop while composing a significant document when the system abruptly ceases operation without preserving the data? This occurrence has transpired for the author and numerous acquaintances, and it was considered to be a particularly unfortunate event. One must contemplate the potential consequences if this were to occur while traveling on an interstate highway with family, resulting in the vehicle’s sudden cessation of function amidst heavy vehicular traffic that could easily crush a small, self-driven vehicle. The author can tolerate the potential loss of data from a hard drive due to a malfunction, but is unwilling to risk one's life to such a system.

Undoubtedly, the prospect of a self-driving machine has captivated many. However, with awareness of the potential issues that could inevitably arise, does the concept remain as appealing?

Could one sustain the maintenance and repair of a two-ton computer with the technological sophistication to provide transportation?

students should be allowed to use phones during lunch period and other free time. not allowing students to bring phones to school at all would anger students and cause them to use their phones anyway at any time they think they can get away with it. it would also create an unnecessary disciplinary task for the staff. banning phones altogether would also create a safety hazard in an emergency, as students would not be able to all communicate outside of school.

in debating on whether to ban phones altogether, we can think back to the times of prohibition. banning phones would have a similar effect. students would simply use their phones in secret to rebel against the rule. students would be angered that they could not bring their phones to school, creating a distraction in class that would not exist if phones were allowed during free time.

also thinking back to prohibition times, we can recall the pains that police forces had to go through to stem the tide of bootleggers. simply banning phones would create an unnecessary task for the staff of the school. it would be a waste of the staff's time to enforce this rule.

banning phones would also create a safety risk during an emergency. if there were a fire or lockdown, very few or no students would be able to communicate with their family or friends. school phones are simply not adequate for the amount of kids that need to call home during an emergency, especially during a fire.

so if your still planning on banning phones, don't! though many may say that they will distract kids, it be worse with a ban. allowing them during free times would eliminate effects such as angry kids using them in secret and the waste of teachers time it would be. all inall, it is better not to risk it, especially in an en=merge",formality,1,4,6.0
20802-CFO,"Dear Principal,

Students ought to be permitted to utilize mobile phones during the lunch period and other times designated for free activity. A complete prohibition on students possessing mobile phones within the school environment would likely engender resentment among the student body and potentially encourage surreptitious usage at times deemed opportune. Furthermore, such a policy would impose an unnecessary burden upon the school’s staff. A blanket ban on mobile phones would also present a potential safety concern in the event of an emergency, as students would be unable to readily communicate with individuals outside of the school premises.

In considering the merits of a complete ban, it is instructive to recall the historical precedent of prohibition. A prohibition on mobile phones would likely produce a comparable outcome. Students would simply circumvent the regulation in clandestine fashion, motivated by a desire to defy the imposed restriction. This would generate discontent among students, thereby creating a classroom disruption that would not be present if mobile phone usage were permitted during designated free periods.

Drawing again upon the historical context of prohibition, we can reflect upon the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in attempting to curtail the activities of bootleggers. A simple ban on mobile phones would create an unnecessary and time-consuming task for school personnel. It would represent a misallocation of staff time and resources.

The prohibition of mobile phones would also introduce a safety risk in the event of an emergency. Should a fire or lockdown occur, a limited number, if any, of students would be capable of communicating with their families or friends. The school’s existing telephone infrastructure is demonstrably inadequate to accommodate the volume of calls that would originate from the student population during an emergency situation, particularly in the event of a fire.

Therefore, if the intention remains to ban mobile phones, it is respectfully advised against. While some may contend that they will prove to be a source of distraction, the repercussions of a ban would be more detrimental. Allowing mobile phone usage during designated free times would eliminate the negative consequences, such as student discontent and the unnecessary expenditure of staff time.

sometimes asking for help gives you the answer you where looking for or it just reassures you and make you feel better about your opinion. it could be a simple yes or no some people ask because it makes them feel better about the scenario, others may use it just to have a back up answer, and sometimes people ask because they are not completely sure what to do and others opinions matter the most to them.

the first reason is because it makes them feel better. it makes them feel better because it makes them feel reassured about their answer. some people need to be reassured because they ether have anxiety and dont want to make a big mistake where people would laugh and make fun of them. i know this because my sister has really bad anxiety and she needs me or my dad to reassure her all the time. a lot of people ask for reassurance they ask two pr more people just to see if they get multiple of the same answers and they use ether what ever one people said the most or the one they like best.

have you ever needed a backup answer? well if so then you can get a back up answer from a friend or two. a lot of people need back up answers in case something pops up. you might need a back up answer if your going out with a boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you make one wrong move with one of them then its over or it could start and argument. thats one good reason you should always have a back up answer they help you out and lets say you forgot your work at home and its due that day now if you dont turn it in then you ether get a zero or a lower grade. some people ask their friends on what to say. all your have to do is change the wording or have a really good excuse.

i dont know about you but i get confused a lot and i mean a lot over the smallest things. it takes me forever to thing of something and sometimes i dont know what to do. when i dont know what to do i usually ask a friend or one of my brothers they can usually give me a pretty good answer on what to do. it could be on anything for example last weekend i had to ask my brothers what should i wear i had no idea what i should wear cause i was going out with friends but surly enough they helped me out by giving me ideas on what the weather was going to be and everything else. and that could be an example of getting confused and needing reassurance.

these are my reasons one why some people ask for advice and why they might talk to more than one person. it helps them feel better about the scenario. it lets them have a back up answer. and last but not least it sometimes people ask because they are not completely sure what to do and others opinions matter the most to them. and thats why people ask more than one person for advice.",formality,1,4,6.0

Some individuals seek it to enhance their sense of well-being regarding a particular scenario; others may utilize it to secure a supplementary answer. Occasionally, individuals inquire because they are not entirely certain of the proper action, and the opinions of others hold significant importance to them.

A primary reason for seeking advice is that it fosters a sense of reassurance. This feeling of reassurance arises from the validation of one's answer. Certain individuals require validation due to anxiety and a desire to avoid significant errors that could result in ridicule. I am aware of this because my sister experiences considerable anxiety and necessitates reassurance from myself or my father. Many individuals seek reassurance from multiple sources to ascertain consistency in responses, subsequently adopting the most prevalent answer or the one they find most agreeable.

Have you ever required a supplementary answer? If so, one can obtain such an answer from a friend or acquaintance. Numerous individuals require backup answers in anticipation of unforeseen circumstances. For instance, one might seek a backup answer when engaged in a romantic relationship, as a single misstep could jeopardize the relationship or initiate a disagreement. This represents a compelling reason to always have a backup answer, as they offer assistance. Consider the scenario where one forgets assigned work at home, and it is due that day; failure to submit it could result in a zero or a diminished grade. Some individuals consult their friends regarding appropriate phrasing, requiring only a modification of wording or a well-constructed explanation.

I am not aware of your experiences, but I often encounter confusion, even over seemingly minor details. It can take a considerable amount of time to formulate a response, and sometimes I am unsure of the proper action. When faced with such uncertainty, I typically consult a friend or one of my brothers, who can usually provide a reasonable answer. This could pertain to any matter; for example, last weekend, I sought my brothers' advice regarding appropriate attire, as I was uncertain of what to wear while socializing with friends. Fortunately, they assisted me by offering suggestions based on anticipated weather conditions and other relevant factors. This exemplifies a situation where confusion necessitates reassurance.

These are my reasons for why some individuals seek advice and why they may consult multiple sources. It fosters a sense of well-being regarding the scenario. It provides a backup answer.

11016-O,"alright, so this facial emotional technology that's supposed to know your emotion based on your facial expressions is wack. the articles says something about how being able to read student's emotions in class is valuable.

the article states that the computer will read a students emotion and modify the lesson if they seem bored or confused. okay so if the student is confused there needs to be a more simple way to put the lesson. how will the computer decide wich way is more simple. what if its more simple way is actually more confusing. or lets say the student is bored, we have the same problem. there isnt much a computer can do to make it more fun. i mean can you even make it more fun besides just wording it differently? it isnt an effective way to do it and even harder for a computer to do so. its far easier for a human instructor to word the lesson differently than a computer because the computer lacks the real connection that a person can have with you.

then theres is chance that the students emotion isnt even related to the lesson, but may be from the outside. maybe they got mad at someone, a loved one died, a breakup maybe, or even thiers parents got divoreced. not only would it be hard for a computer to determine the emotion is caused by an outside force but even to figure a way to help. the technology may even be wasted on helping students when there could be better use for it.

the article doesnt give you much evidence as to wether this would help besides saying it will modify the lesson. how, in what way?

not only would it be difficult to do this, but would it even be effective? so maybe it is a little effective and the computer can put some things on screen to make you happy, but if it isnt that effective then there is no good uses for it and no one will use it. if you are creating something that can add value or help people in some way, it cant just be barely effective or even just a little. the cost of making this, testing it, and everything else going into the program, and for it to just kind of work is not an effective way to help people or even get them to consider to use it because it will just waste their time more than anything.

11016-CFO,"The purported facial emotional technology, which aims to ascertain an individual’s emotional state through facial expressions, presents significant concerns. The referenced article posits that the ability to interpret student emotions within a classroom setting holds value.

The article indicates that a computer system would analyze a student’s emotional state and subsequently adjust the lesson plan if indications of boredom or confusion are detected. However, if a student exhibits confusion, a more accessible explanation should ideally be implemented. It remains unclear how the computer system would determine the most comprehensible approach. Furthermore, it is possible that a computer’s simplified explanation could inadvertently increase confusion. Similarly, if a student appears bored, the efficacy of computer-generated modifications is questionable. The capacity to genuinely enhance engagement extends beyond mere alterations in wording; it is doubtful that a computer can achieve this. Consequently, this approach proves ineffective, and its implementation by a computer system is problematic. A human instructor possesses a distinct advantage, owing to the ability to establish a meaningful connection with students, which facilitates more nuanced and responsive lesson delivery.

Moreover, a student’s emotional state may be unrelated to the lesson itself, stemming from external factors. These factors could include interpersonal conflicts, bereavement, relationship dissolution, or familial separation. Not only would it be challenging for a computer to discern an emotion’s origin in external circumstances, but devising appropriate assistance would also be difficult. Such technology may prove superfluous, diverting resources that could be better allocated.

The article provides limited substantiation regarding the potential benefits of this technology, simply stating that lessons would be modified. The specific nature of these modifications remains unspecified.

Beyond the practical difficulties, the overall effectiveness of this technology warrants scrutiny. While it is conceivable that a computer could display visual stimuli to elicit positive emotions, the marginal gains are unlikely to justify the considerable investment. The expenses associated with development, testing, and ongoing maintenance are substantial; a marginally functional program lacks the requisite value to encourage adoption or to justify the expenditure of resources.

Ultimately, human emotions are characterized by a complexity that surpasses the capacity of current technology to accurately recognize and effectively address.",formality,0,4,1.0

as you heard from my horrific story, not everyone's ideas are going to be fit for you and you have to be patient and take your time to find the really best option. just because an idea sounds cool doesn't mean it's going to turn out the way you hope. what my mother tells me and your mother probably told you is that, ""if someone jumps off a bridge, you would do it too?"" what they're telling us is if someone says it would be a moment to remember if you guys jumped off a cliff, just think how great that idea really sounds and where you'll end up. i'll wait as long as you need. are you ready? the hospital, that's where you'll end up, or worse! how does that life changing adventure sound now? still wanna jump off a cliff? no? your welcome.

did i have any experience in those heart-stopping games? no. did i listen to someone who had no experience in those regretful activities? yes. should i have listened to more people who had experience in that area of witch craft? absolutely! now that i am older i know that what we did was not that scary and wasn't even haunting but i sure regret ruining my once exciting birthday party. if you are in desperate need for advice go to someone with experience and not someone who doesn't even know what a ghost is. let's say my friend who was opposing to the idea did have a say in the matter, i would have a much more pleasing party and all the kids wouldn't be sent home with their nails digging into their parents' arms. one wrong statement can change the whole situation and one pleasing eight year old appropriate idea can save parties.

finding someone who cares about you can also affect the situation. if someone cares about you than they will think more about it and give you their best possible opinion. if you go up to someone you're not as close with or not fond of they won't put in any effort to make sure their option is safe or won't even give you their opinion. years later and my friend that suggested that dreadful idea and i have drifted apart like a broken magnet and if we were close enough than maybe we wouldn't have gone our separate ways and she would've given me a less spine-chilling idea for my birthday party.

my nightmares are no more but my regret is still there popping up every once in a while to remind me to not make the same mistakes i made back then. to make better decisions in the future i will(and you should too) find the best option that is right for me, find someone with experience in what i am asking for, and ask a friend not a foe. trust me, ask around, don't agree with anything you might regret. take my advice, or don't, or multiple, just pick the one that's right for you.",formality,1,4,6.0
24084-CFO,"A sudden, loud crash of thunder startled me awake from a disturbing dream, and beads of sweat trickled down my forehead. With trembling knees, I proceeded to the bathroom to alleviate a dry mouth, muttering to myself a vow never to accept advice from a single individual again. When I was younger, I sought advice from a friend regarding appropriate games for my birthday party. She recommended several games with a spooky theme, a suggestion that I was hesitant about, and another friend expressed considerable disagreement. I ultimately conceded, believing that people would enjoy the activities, but everyone, including my friend, became frightened, necessitating the premature termination of the unsettling games and ultimately ruining my birthday celebration. That night, I experienced a nightmare concerning the event and resolved to consistently solicit opinions and advice from multiple sources.

Obtaining advice from more than one person is essential, as not all ideas will necessarily represent the optimal choice. Individual opinions are invariably shaped by personal experiences, and consulting someone lacking relevant experience can significantly alter the outcome of a situation. Furthermore, seeking guidance from someone not closely connected to you may result in a diminished effort to provide thoughtful advice.

As illustrated by my unfortunate experience, not all ideas are suitable for every individual, and patience is required to identify the most effective solution. The mere appeal of an idea does not guarantee a favorable outcome. A common adage, often conveyed by parents, posits, “If one person jumps off a bridge, would you follow?” This illustrates that one should carefully consider the implications of an idea before acting upon it. Consider the potential consequences: a trip to the hospital, or worse! Does that “life-changing adventure” still sound appealing? No? You are welcome.

I lacked any experience in the unsettling games that I participated in. Consequently, I listened to someone with no experience in those regrettable activities. I should have listened to individuals who possessed experience in that particular domain. Now that I am older, I recognize that the activities were not particularly frightening, but I still regret spoiling what was once an exciting birthday party. Should you find yourself in need of advice, seek guidance from someone experienced, rather than someone unfamiliar with even the concept of a ghost. Had the friend who initially opposed the idea been given a voice, I likely would have hosted a more enjoyable party, and the children would not have fled home with their fingernails embedded in their parents’ arms. A single ill-conceived statement can drastically alter a situation, while a well-considered idea can save a party.

The level of concern someone has for you can also impact the outcome. If someone cares about you, they will give your request considerable thought and provide their most thoughtful opinion. Conversely, seeking advice from someone with whom you are not close may result in a lack of effort to ensure the safety or validity of their suggestion. Years later, the friend who suggested the dreadful idea and I have drifted apart, much like a broken magnet. Had we maintained a closer relationship, she might have offered a less chilling suggestion for my birthday party.

My nightmares have subsided, but my regret persists, occasionally resurfacing to remind me not to repeat the mistakes of my past. To make more informed decisions in the future, I will – and you should too – identify the most suitable option, seek advice from someone with experience, and consult a friend, rather than a stranger. Trust me, gather multiple opinions; do not commit to anything you might regret. Consider my advice, or disregard it, or seek multiple opinions, simply select the option that is right for you.",formality,0,4,6.0

one reason i believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. the ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. the landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. if you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but if you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. in addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.

that part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. notice photo two? its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. this is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on mars.

if you still do not believe me, then this next part will. if you think about it, why would nasa keep an amazing discover like this a secret? the answer is that they would not. if nasa went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. it does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.

in conclusion, nasa is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. therefore; this ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",formality,1,4,6.0
11728-CFO,"NASA, the United States’ prominent space academy, launched the Viking 1 spacecraft in 2001. This spacecraft was directed toward Mars, a planet similar to Earth. Viking 1’s companion spacecraft, Viking 2, was also intended for landing on Mars, which is why Viking 1 was initially dispatched into space. During its photographic survey, Viking 1’s camera detected a peculiar, face-like structure on the Martian surface. Some individuals posit that this is a mysterious structure constructed by extraterrestrial beings. However, I do not find this reasoning to be credible. I believe that this is a simple, naturally occurring landform, produced by subsurface volcanoes, a sandy surface, and the deposition of rocks.

One reason for this belief stems from an examination of the photographic evidence. The purported “face” lacks a discernible or intentional shape that would be desired by either humans or extraterrestrial beings. A deliberately constructed structure would likely be circular, square, or another straightforward form, and it would not exhibit such rigidity or cracking. Furthermore, if one were to observe the photograph furthest to the left, it might appear to resemble a face; however, a comparison of that image with a photograph taken twenty-five years later reveals that the initial photograph was outdated and that the camera’s resolution was inferior. It is also illogical to assume that an alien civilization would construct a structure resembling a human face.

The angle at which the camera was positioned provides additional context. Note photograph two? The perspective suggests a small mountain range looming over the surrounding terrain. This observation provides critical evidence supporting the conclusion that this is merely a natural landmark on Mars.

If one remains unconvinced, the following consideration may prove persuasive. Why would NASA conceal a discovery of such significance? The answer is that they would not. If NASA publicized this “face,” they would generate substantially more revenue than even millionaires or other space academies. It is improbable that the academy would deliberately suppress evidence of an extraterrestrial encounter.

In conclusion, NASA demonstrates either courage or imprudence in failing to disclose information regarding this “so-called face,” or individuals may simply seek to disseminate information to elicit criticism, induce feelings of inadequacy in others, or to assert their perceived correctness, even when their assertions are demonstrably incorrect. Therefore, this “so-called face” is not a deliberate construction, but rather a natural landmark formed by geological processes, rather than by alien life-forms.",formality,0,4,6.0
19156-O,"we should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons.  one, big states.  two, avoid run off eclections. finnaly, to determide the certainty of outcome.

first, the issue of big states.  states are put in two catogories, big states and small states, accoring to population. presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campain to the larger states.  as a result of electral college the big states have more elctors and thus more votes.  for example, in forida, the popular vote was extermly close in 2012,  obama who won, got 29 electoral votes.  if obama had spent that time in wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes.

second, to avoid run off elections. using the eectoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority.  the electoral college can procuce a clear winner rather than pressure when no canidate wins majority and complications of the process. two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president nixan and president clinton.  they both had 43 percent pluarlity of popular vote, while winning a majority of elcetoral college.

finnally, to determine certainty of outcome. since, almost all states have electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, even the slightest pluarlity in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in tht state. although, it is possible to have a dispoute over the outcome of an electoral colege, for instance in 20000, it is much less likley than a dispute over the popualr vote. and even though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number of 538, it is extremly unlikey to happen.

you could argue that the method of slecting a president through electoral college may turn off potential voters for a canidate that has no hope if carrying their state,  knowing their vote will have no effect.  then they might have less incentive to pay attention to the campaingn. but being realisic, no voters one vote swings a natioal electon, and about one half of the eligable american population did vote in 2012's election.

in conclution, the reasons we shoud kee our current method of chosng the countroies president is becuause of big states, to avoid run off elections, and to determine he certainty of outcome. even though some dont agree it has been working for us in the past an can contiue working for us to chose our president in the future.            ",formality,1,4,6.0
19156-CFO,"We ought to maintain our present method of selecting a president, despite disagreements, for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the consideration of large states. Secondly, it prevents runoff elections. Finally, it establishes the certainty of the outcome.

Initially, the matter of large states requires examination. States are categorized as either large or small, based on population. Presidential candidates tend to devote more attention during the campaign to the larger states. Due to the Electoral College, the larger states possess more electors and, consequently, more votes. For instance, in Florida, the popular vote was exceedingly close in 2012; President Obama received 29 electoral votes. Had he allocated that time in Wyoming, he would have only obtained 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, the Electoral College prevents the necessity of runoff elections. Utilizing this system, we circumvent the predicament of elections where no candidate secures a majority. The Electoral College can produce a definitive winner, rather than generating pressure when no candidate attains a majority, and complicating the process. Two examples of this occurred in 1968 and 1992, with President Nixon and President Clinton, respectively. They both achieved a 43 percent plurality of the popular vote, while simultaneously winning a majority of electoral votes.

Finally, the Electoral College serves to determine the certainty of the outcome. Since almost all states utilize a winner-take-all basis for electoral votes, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory for that state. Although disputes concerning the outcome of an Electoral College election are possible, such as in 2000, they are considerably less likely than disputes concerning the popular vote. Moreover, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is theoretically possible due to the total number of votes being an even number of 538, it is exceedingly unlikely.

It could be asserted that the method of selecting a president through the Electoral College might discourage potential voters for a candidate who has little prospect of carrying their state, knowing that their vote will have no effect. Consequently, they might have reduced incentive to engage with the campaign. However, realistically, no single voter’s vote determines a national election, and approximately one-half of the eligible American population participated in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the reasons we should retain our present method of choosing the country’s president are due to the consideration of large states, the prevention of runoff elections, and the determination of the certainty of the outcome. Even though some disagree, it has been effective in the past and can continue to function effectively in selecting our president in the future.",formality,0,4,6.0
24402-O,"ugh! have you ever been stuck in a tough decision? were deciding your actions the toughest thing out of everything else? that's why seeking advice from others is helpful and it has many benefits. asking others about your problem can offer you others' point of view on your situation, it gives you multiple choices on what you're going to do, and it also allows you to have an idea on what you're going to do. as you can see, advice can be very rewarding and useful when you get stuck in situations.

first, you can see others' point of view on your problem. advice can allow you to see what other people would choose to do if they were placed in your spot. for example, if you were deciding whether to hang out with friends or complete your school assignments, you could ask a friend. they would probably state what they would choose, and back it up with reasons why they chose what they chose. you would receive advice and why you should choose that option. one opinion can help you choose what you'd like to do or say. although seeking more than just one can give you more choices and options.

secondly, it gives you multiple options and often gives you an idea on what you're going to go with. to me, its like a video game. for instance, lets say you are battling a final boss, the game lets you choose what to do next. if you have one opinion thats your own, you'll only have that one choice and would have to go along with it because you didn't receive any other opinions from others. if you do explore others' thinking, you'll have more options to defeat that final boss.

finally, after receiving all those ideas on what others would do if they were placed in your shoes, you can get your own idea on what to do. if you didn't like what they had to say if it was their decision, you can combine multiple opinions to produce your own to choose in your battle of choice.

its like a math equation! if you have three plus blank is equal to six, you need that one number to complete the expression. the three represents your opinion and the blank represents someone else's opinion, when you get theirs, it's complete! you have an idea of what to do.

all in all, i think advice is a good thing. it can help out in any sort of problem you're stuck in. it is useful and again, it comes with many great outcomes. no more ugh!

when you get advice, it turns into a whoo hoo!

you aren't stuck in a tough decision anymore! and you owe it all to asking for advice from friends and family. if you're ever stuck in a tough decision, i suggest asking for advice. ",formality,1,4,6.0
24402-CFO,"Ugh! Have you ever encountered a difficult decision? Was determining your course of action the most challenging aspect of the situation? This is why seeking counsel from others proves beneficial, possessing numerous advantages. Requesting perspectives on your problem can offer alternative viewpoints on your situation, providing multiple choices regarding your intended actions, and also allowing you to formulate an idea regarding what you are going to do. As can be observed, advice can be quite rewarding and useful when one is faced with difficult circumstances.

Firstly, one can gain insight into alternative viewpoints regarding your problem. Counsel can allow you to perceive what other individuals would elect to do if they were in your position. For example, if one were deciding whether to socialize with friends or complete assigned schoolwork, one could inquire of a friend. They would likely articulate their preferred choice, and substantiate it with reasons for their selection. You would receive guidance and the rationale behind that particular option. A single opinion can assist in determining what you would like to do or say. Although, soliciting more than just one can provide additional choices and options.

Secondly, it provides multiple options and often provides an idea regarding your intended course of action. To me, it is similar to a video game. For instance, let us say you are confronting a final boss; the game allows you to choose what to do next. If you possess one opinion, which is your own, you will only have that single choice and would have to proceed with it because you did not receive any other opinions from others. If you do explore the perspectives of others, you will have more options to overcome that final boss.

Finally, after receiving various ideas regarding what others would do if they were in your situation, you can develop your own idea regarding what to do. If you did not agree with what they had to say, or if it was their preferred decision, you can combine multiple opinions to formulate your own choice in your deliberation of choice.

It is similar to a mathematical equation! If three plus blank equals six, you require that single number to complete the expression. The three represents your opinion and the blank represents another individual’s opinion; when you obtain theirs, it is complete! You have an idea regarding what to do.

Overall, I believe advice is a positive attribute. It can assist in resolving any type of problem you are facing. It is useful and, again, it accompanies numerous beneficial outcomes. No more expressions of frustration!

When you receive advice, it becomes a moment of excitement!

parents are often the people kids or adults go to. since they have been around longer and been through drama before, they might know more than your average friend. parents always have good advice to give. there advice will help you with a lot of things your going through. most of the time kids go to there parents because they dont like other peoples opinions and they just want to here what a adult thinks about the situation. parents will help you make a smart, reasonable decision on what to do.

lots of people go to their friends for advice because their friends might know more about that person than your parents or teacher do, or they think they can relate since there both young or the same age. there friends might give good advice if they have gone through the same thing or something similar. thats why people go to their friends for help. it's also because many people don't trust other people and think they might tell the person your fighting with what you were taking about. so they go to there parents or their best friend for help so it dosn't cause any more drama.

it's good to have multiple opinions because there other people that could have more knowledge than most, or you can trust one person better than the rest. multiple opinions matter because they help someone make a better decision on what do, just like when i went to my parents and friends for advice. they helped me make the right decision on what to do about the fight. there advice helped me so much. if i had asked one person it think the fight would have gone down differently. multiple peoples opinions matter in making smart choices.      ",formality,1,4,6.0
24986-CFO,"When I require someone to speak with or necessitate counsel, I consistently consult numerous individuals. During a disagreement with a peer, I sought advice from both my friends and my parents. It is advantageous to acquire input from multiple sources, rather than relying on a singular perspective. This may involve consulting parents, friends, or instructors; however, obtaining numerous perspectives is demonstrably superior to receiving only one.

Parents are frequently the individuals to whom children or adults turn for guidance. Given their greater experience and prior exposure to challenging situations, they may possess a more comprehensive understanding than an average friend. Parents are typically prepared to offer valuable counsel, which can be instrumental in navigating various difficulties. Often, children seek parental advice because they prefer the perspectives of adults and desire to understand the situation from a more mature viewpoint. Parents can facilitate the formulation of a judicious and sensible decision regarding appropriate action.

Numerous individuals seek counsel from their friends because their friends may possess a more detailed understanding of a particular person than parents or instructors. Alternatively, they may perceive a relatable connection due to shared youth or similar age. Friends may provide beneficial advice if they have encountered comparable circumstances. This is a primary reason why individuals seek assistance from their friends. Furthermore, many individuals harbor a lack of trust and fear that confidential information might be disclosed to the individual with whom they are in conflict. Consequently, they turn to parents or a confidant to avoid exacerbating the situation.

It is beneficial to consider multiple perspectives, as there may be individuals with greater knowledge or to whom one feels a stronger sense of trust. Multiple opinions are significant because they assist in making a more informed decision, as evidenced by my own experience seeking advice from parents and friends regarding a disagreement. Their counsel proved invaluable, and I believe that a singular opinion might have resulted in a less favorable outcome.

5933-O,"trophies, medals, awards and praise, our school could use a lot more of these and you could too! why not make your contribution by joining an extracurricular activity? coming home to too much free time and nothing to do is something we all suffer from, so is simply not being included. our students should listen to our principal and solve this lonely epidemic of too much free time while doing what you're good at and what you love by joining a club, sport or any extracurricular activity! students should all participate in an extracurricular because they have the opportunity to feel included in a team, be acknowledged for their talents, and improve their skills.

feeling included isn't something anyone can just make happen, and the cliche ""just talk to people"" isn't very helpful in a school with thousands of other students. it is hard for one to put themselves out there. however, when in an extracurricular, students are surrounded by people who chose to be there because they have the same interests as them. when there are people who are just like you by your side, you can easily find a common interest to bond over rather than talking about nothing to someone who you know nothing about, a stranger. students have peers within that group or club also need them for that extracurricular because no matter what they are apart of, an extracurricular makes a team! no one can be excluded in a team, because every member works together and relies on each other. being apart of a club or sport means students are surrounded by their friends who all are doing what they love together, almost like a family.

imagine, a student is out there and doing what they love most and what they are best at, once they're finished, students are rewarded with trophies, medals, and praise! it's almost everyone's fantasy, so make it reality! students should not daydream about what their life could be and what they want it be when it is a very real possibility to make happen! our students deserve to be acknowledged for their amazing talents. there is always something for everyone. join an extracurricular activity to get credit where credit is due.

no one can ever be perfect and there is always something one can improve of themselves. however, no one may never be able to improve and build their skills if a situation does not present itself for one to realize what their weakness is. it is hard to meet such an opportunity if we never take risks and ""play it safe"". an extracurricular will help us improve those weaknesses and even our strong ones to be the best that we can be by presenting us with a new challenge everyday. those skills may be related to our athletic or mental capabilities, but no matter what activity students may be apart of, it is certain one can improve their teamwork and cooperation skills. students are also working with their peers who may have more experience and can help guide them through obstacles and can share their wisdom on how to improve their skills.

taking risks and trying something new is always scary. however, there will always be an excuse not to do something and we will never know what we are missing out on if we never even try. we could surprise ourselves and others by going beyond our expectations and being able to tell the story of the time we tried something new. students may just be alone and feeling excluded with the push needed to encourage them to get them outside and into the open. an extracurricular will always lead students to new opportunities like being apart of a team, building skills with those around them, and being praised and rewarded for what they are best at.",formality,1,5,6.0
5933-CFO,"Trophies, medals, awards, and recognition – our school could certainly benefit from an increase in these, and so could you. Consider contributing by participating in an extracurricular activity. Experiencing excessive free time and a lack of engagement, or simply feeling excluded, are issues many students face. Students should heed the principal’s advice and address this pervasive sense of isolation while pursuing their passions and talents through clubs, sports, or other extracurricular endeavors. Participation in extracurricular activities is beneficial as it provides opportunities for students to feel included within a team, receive acknowledgment for their abilities, and enhance their skills.

A sense of belonging is not easily manufactured, and the common suggestion to ""simply socialize"" is often unhelpful within a large school environment. It can be challenging for an individual to assert themselves. However, when participating in an extracurricular activity, students are surrounded by individuals who have chosen to be present due to shared interests. The presence of peers with similar interests facilitates the development of common ground, rather than engaging in superficial conversations with strangers. Furthermore, students within a group or club require one another, as extracurricular activities inherently foster a sense of teamwork. Exclusion is impossible within a team, as all members collaborate and depend upon each other. Being part of a club or sport means students are surrounded by friends who are all engaged in activities they enjoy, creating a familial atmosphere.

Imagine a student actively pursuing their greatest passion and demonstrating exceptional skill; upon completion, they are recognized with trophies, medals, and praise! This is a common aspiration, and it can be realized. Students should not merely fantasize about their ideal lives when it is a tangible possibility to achieve them. Our students deserve acknowledgment for their remarkable talents. There is a suitable activity for everyone. Joining an extracurricular activity ensures that credit is given where credit is due.

Perfection is unattainable, and continuous self-improvement is always possible. However, skill development is often impeded by a lack of opportunity to identify areas for improvement. Such opportunities are rarely encountered if one avoids risks and maintains a cautious approach. Extracurricular activities facilitate skill enhancement, even in areas of strength, by presenting daily challenges. These skills may be related to physical or mental capabilities, but regardless of the activity, students will inevitably improve their teamwork and cooperation skills. Students also interact with peers who may possess greater experience and can offer guidance and share insights on skill development.

Taking risks and trying new things can be daunting. However, there will always be reasons not to act, and one may never know what opportunities are missed without effort. Students may surprise themselves and others by exceeding expectations and sharing stories of their willingness to embrace new experiences. Students who feel isolated may require encouragement to venture out and engage with others. Extracurricular activities consistently lead to new opportunities, such as belonging to a team, developing skills alongside peers, and receiving praise and rewards for demonstrated abilities.",formality,0,5,6.0
4360-O,"well it's getting close to that time of year again, summer time! warm air, bright shinning sun, and many activities that are only available during the summer season. but if you are like some students who go to certain schools maybe not so much. some schools across the country require students to preform school based learning projects during their summer break. there projects are said to continue in helping kids and teens learn about subjects outside of school. most of the projects are given by the teacher for the student to complete but some think that this decision should change.

what many teachers don't realize is that teenagers are slowly being thrown into adulthood. every year we have seen more and more teenagers be pushed into adult responsibility even when they are so young. many students have to get jobs in the summer to support their families and help them. some students work on farms which require all hands on deck. some students even have wives and children to take care of. while the idea of the over the summer projects are neat they really should be student run. while teachers might have more neater and straight forward assignments, student based projects would give them the power. this would give them the power to give themselves an opportunity to learn about a subject they were always interested in and wish to pursue further.

busy, work based lives are what many students go home to everyday. since their is no school during the summer students, manly teenagers, are pushed into work. now some teens and kids want summer jobs to make some cash or just to have experience in something. but some unlucky students are forced into work not because they want to but because they have too. many students nowadays, with numbers growing more and more everyday, have to work to survive. many teens and young adults come from broken homes with high divorce rates and low long time marriage rates. some students don't have fathers or mothers who work, some live with their grandparents, while some sadly live on their own. most of the student complete high school with no drive to pursue higher knowledge while others do. the ones who do have that drive want the power to make a choice, to chose who and what they want to be. i was lucky enough to have to parents growing up, unfortunately i know a lot who don't. these students want the power this time and the choice to choose what they want to do. they want to be able to pick the subject that they are interested in and pursue it, this time with nothing and no one in their way.

many students in the united states have been diagnosed with a learning disability. whether is be reading, understand, or they just generally struggle to grasp a concept, these student have it hard. they are already given a disadvantage when they enter into the learning ring. many of the students attend summer programs to assist them with their disabilities. many teachers do not take this into account which leads to upset, angry, and stressed out students who truly can't help it. however, with them in control of these summer projects they could make something that conforms to them. the project, with them behind the learning wheel, could also assist them with their disability. they could make it something they understand and can learn at their own pace while also learning about something they enjoy. they can finally be set free and be given the power and choice to learn a pursuing subject, but also have something that conforms to their personal needs.

students as a word is something that a lot of people see as a word used to describe kids and teens who go to school, learn, then return to perfect homes. that might have been the case year ago, but not anymore. in today's society kids and teens are being pushed to take responsibility. they are being pushed to work and survive without guidance from parental figures. the idea of the over the summer projects is neat, but if they are truly going to work then the students should be in control. getting a choice and a say so in the matter is what may students long for and want, because they may have never had it before. they get to choose and pursue something they may have always dreamed of and want to chase after. with nothing holding them back except their drive and imaginations, these students will finally have a choice to follow their dreams to something much bigger.",formality,1,5,6.0
4360-CFO,"Well, as the end of the school year approaches, the time for summer arrives. This brings warm weather, bright sunshine, and numerous activities exclusive to the summer season. However, for some students attending certain schools, the experience may be quite different. Some schools across the nation mandate students to complete school-based learning projects during their summer break. These projects are intended to continue assisting children and adolescents in learning about subjects outside of the traditional school curriculum. However, many believe this policy should be reconsidered.

What many educators fail to recognize is that adolescents are progressively entering adulthood. Each year, teenagers are increasingly burdened with adult responsibilities, even at a young age. Many students are required to obtain employment during the summer to support their families and contribute financially. Some students work on farms, which necessitate the involvement of all available labor. Some students even have spouses and children for whom they are responsible. While the concept of summer projects appears beneficial, they should be student-directed. While teachers may design structured assignments, student-led projects would empower students. This would grant them the opportunity to explore subjects they are genuinely interested in and wish to pursue further.

Busy, work-focused lives are commonplace for many students upon returning home daily. During the summer, when school is adjourned, students, particularly teenagers, are often compelled into work. While some teenagers and children desire summer jobs to earn money or gain experience, other students are unfortunately forced into work not by choice, but by necessity. A growing number of students today must work to survive. Many teenagers and young adults come from broken homes, characterized by high divorce rates and infrequent long-term marriages. Some students lack fathers or mothers who work; some reside with their grandparents; and some, sadly, live independently. Most students complete high school with little motivation to pursue higher education, while others maintain a strong desire to do so. Those with this drive want the power to make choices, to select their desired path. I was fortunate to have two parents growing up; however, I know many who were not so lucky. These students desire the agency and choice to determine their course of action. They wish to select a subject of interest and pursue it without restriction.

Many students in the United States have been diagnosed with a learning disability. Whether it be difficulty reading, understanding concepts, or general struggles with grasping information, these students face significant challenges. They are already disadvantaged when entering the learning environment. Many of these students attend summer programs to assist them with their disabilities. Many educators do not take this into account, which leads to frustrated, angry, and stressed-out students who are genuinely unable to help their situation. However, if these students were in control of these summer projects, they could create something that aligns with their individual needs. The project, with students directing their own learning, could also assist them with their disability. They could tailor the learning experience to their pace and interests.

The term ""students"" is often perceived as describing children and teenagers who attend school, learn, and return to stable homes. While this may have been the case in the past, it is no longer entirely accurate. In today's society, children and teenagers are being compelled to take responsibility. They are being pushed to work and survive without consistent parental guidance. The concept of summer projects is appealing; however, if they are to be effective, students should have control. The opportunity to choose and have a voice in the matter is what many students desire, as they may never have had it before. They can choose and pursue something they have always dreamed of and wished to achieve. With nothing holding them back except their own drive and imagination, these students will finally have the choice to follow their dreams towards something greater.",formality,0,5,6.0
23841-O,"a lot of people like to go do things on their own,but asking people for advice is a more effective way then trying to do everything on your own. the reason going to multiple people is more effective than trying to figure out everything on ones own is because people can get different perspectives, better explanations and talk to people who are more mature and understand better. if a person tries something new they might be a little scared, it would be better to ask for advice from more than one person because that person could get there different opinions on the situation. a person could also get a better explanation because one may not help that person fully so another person might explain it better. when a person needs help they may be immature and not understand how to do certain things so when other people are more mature and understand better they might be able to help more.

my first example of why people should get advice from multiple people is because a person could get there different perspectives. that person will get to know how people look at things from their view and how they see it so then that person could take one of their perspectives and look at it as their own. another reason would be more options, if a person had more options from different people it will make things a little easier to do things. if somebody has to speak in front of a crowd they might have a fear of public speaking, so if they ask others who have done it before how they did it with such confidence they will have peoples different ways of how they overcame stage fright and they could find which way works best for them and use it. having peoples different perspectives on things really help because one will have more options and with that comes how others look at things and so much more with any of those things.

my second example of why people should get advice from more than one person is so that they can get a better explanation. a person might not be sure how to something so they ask multiple people because one did not explain good enough and left things out. when people don't fully explain things like a person wants them too or like they need them too everyone that person asked might end up putting everything they said together as one or one person may explain it deeper and get into more details than anyone else. a person might want to learn how to sail and their parents know how to sail, but they know other people who sail better than their parents but their parents want to teach them so they could ask their parents to help them sail and anything that was left out they could ask the other people that they know. when someone gets a better explanation on something they don't know, it feels great to know that they know what they are doing and that they are doing it right.

my last example of why people should get advice from more than one person is so they can get advice from a more mature person. age comes with maturity so if a person asked other people and they don't know then asking people who are older and who have more experience will mos likely mean that the person will get better advice. since some people have more knowledge than other people a person knows they will most likely be able to help more because that means they know more than you and can help more. a person might be getting in to trouble at school and their friends want to help but don't understand why that person is getting in to trouble so they don't know how to help but that persons mom is older and wiser so she understands why they are getting in to trouble and knows what to say and how exactly to help. if one talks to older and wiser then they will get better advice from different people.

those are the reasons why talking to more people will help one more than just listening to them self and only doing what they think is right. all of those reasons connect to each other because if a person listens to peoples different perspectives then they will have a better explanation from more mature people. there are limits to why a person should take advice from multiple people, only that person knows them self clearly so that's why sometimes people have a hard time listening to others. it is still better to take ones chances of failure listening to others trying to help rather than not try at all and fail with no fight. those are my reasons for why people should take others advice and not just there own.",formality,1,5,2.0
23841-CFO,"Many individuals prefer to undertake activities independently; however, seeking counsel from multiple people represents a more effective approach than attempting to manage everything solely on one's own. The rationale for consulting numerous individuals rather than relying exclusively on personal judgment lies in the potential to acquire diverse perspectives, receive more comprehensive explanations, and engage with individuals possessing greater maturity and understanding. When an individual initiates a novel endeavor, apprehension may arise; consequently, soliciting advice from a variety of sources proves advantageous, as it facilitates the acquisition of differing viewpoints regarding the situation. Furthermore, a more thorough explanation may be obtained, as one individual's clarification may prove inadequate, while another may offer a more detailed and insightful explanation. Individuals encountering challenges may lack the maturity to fully comprehend certain processes; therefore, guidance from more experienced and knowledgeable individuals can prove invaluable.

My initial illustration concerning the benefits of seeking counsel from multiple sources pertains to the acquisition of diverse perspectives. Through this process, an individual gains insight into how others perceive situations and formulate their viewpoints, thereby enabling the adoption of a perspective that aligns with their own. Another significant advantage is the availability of expanded options; when presented with a range of suggestions from various individuals, the execution of tasks becomes considerably simpler. For example, an individual experiencing anxiety regarding public speaking may benefit from consulting those with prior experience. By learning the strategies employed by others to overcome stage fright, the individual can identify techniques that resonate with their own approach. The accumulation of diverse perspectives undeniably contributes to enhanced decision-making, providing a broader range of options and facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the matter at hand.

My second example underscores the importance of obtaining a more comprehensive explanation through consultation with multiple sources. An individual may encounter difficulties comprehending a particular process, necessitating inquiry from several individuals. If one's initial explanation proves insufficient or incomplete, subsequent consultations can rectify these deficiencies, culminating in a more complete understanding. When individuals collectively synthesize their explanations, a more thorough and nuanced perspective emerges. Consider an individual aspiring to learn how to sail; while parental guidance may be available, consulting individuals with greater expertise can supplement this knowledge and address any gaps. The satisfaction derived from a complete understanding fosters confidence and ensures the correct execution of the task.

My final example emphasizes the value of receiving counsel from more mature individuals. Age is frequently associated with increased maturity; consequently, seeking guidance from older, more experienced individuals is likely to yield more effective advice. Individuals possessing greater knowledge are better equipped to provide assistance, as their expertise surpasses that of the individual seeking counsel. For instance, an individual facing disciplinary issues at school may benefit from consulting their mother, who, possessing greater wisdom and understanding, can provide guidance and support. Seeking counsel from individuals with greater maturity and experience invariably leads to more effective solutions.

In conclusion, engaging with multiple individuals offers greater benefit than relying solely on personal judgment. These advantages are interconnected; the acquisition of diverse perspectives facilitates more comprehensive explanations from more mature individuals. While there are limitations to seeking external advice, the potential for positive outcomes outweighs the risks. It is preferable to embrace the possibility of failure through external guidance than to forgo assistance entirely. These are my reasons for advocating the acceptance of advice from others rather than relying solely on personal intuition.",formality,0,5,6.0

Today, fellow citizens must recognize the harm to the world caused by the increasing reliance on cars. The advantages of limiting automobile usage offer a benefit, promoting communities that are less dependent on cars and representing an improvement in air pollution consequences. The advantages of beginning to limit car usage can have numerous beneficial effects worldwide.

Initially, the advantages of limiting car usage provide a benefit because communities will be less reliant on cars. In source 3, paragraph 28, the author explains an example of a benefit from reduced car usage, stating, ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have emerged."" This demonstrates how individuals are using cars less by walking, which increases physical activity, reduces traffic accidents, and stimulates the economy through shopping, utilizing funds previously spent on fuel. There are additional benefits, such as those detailed in source 3, paragraph 28, which indicate that ""parks and sports centers have also flourished throughout the city."" This implies that when the author states ""flourished"" throughout the city, it illustrates how individuals of all ages are beginning to enjoy outdoor activities, particularly in parks and sports centers, resulting in increased participation. This provides individuals with the advantage of exploring new people and challenges, decreasing issues in the world, such as obesity, low self-esteem, and poor health. While automobile usage can be a necessity, it is a fact that decreasing car usage can only bring benefits, as demonstrated worldwide. This solution could initiate a multitude of opportunities that can benefit not only in one way but in many.

Moreover, the advantages of limiting car usage can result in an improvement in air pollution consequences. The issues of harmful gases released from cars have contributed to problems and consequences, such as global warming, due to excessive air pollution. In source 4, paragraph 29, the author explains an advantage of reduced car usage for global warming, stating, ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will receive a fortuitous assist from an emerging shift in American behavior; recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses each year."" This explains how the decrease in car usage has protected the ozone layer from harmful gases emitted by car exhaust, fuel, and chemicals, leading to more manageable rates of global warming. While using cars may be beneficial for reducing fatigue and body pain, worldwide, limiting car usage, with these improvements, has only brought benefits for a better place to breathe air that is becoming less harmful and a cleaner environment to live in, decreasing the presence of newborn bacteria that can be harmful. Improving global warming is something that benefits everyone, now and in the future.

6952-O,"the principal is making the kids stay after, good or bad? extracurricular activities can benefit many students in many ways. not all students play sports or participate in any activity which requires interaction with peers outside of school. many students at many schools are obese because of matters like this, playing an after school sport may benefit them, and many other students may discover a hobby or sport that they excel at or are interested in. i agree with the principal for making every student stay after and participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students a chance to make new friends, stay active, and help develop social skills.

staying after school can help every student with making friends. playing sports usually requires students to be on a team, and a team requires teamwork. to establish a good foundation for teamwork students need to know the members of their team, this will result in making friends. making friends can help many students with many things. students that suffer from depression can largely benefit from making friends as they will find people who will help their self-esteem and make them feel a lot better. students that may have no real friends or people that they talk to on a daily basis can largely benefit from playing sports or being in a group that requires collaboration, such as yearbook or student council.

participating in extracurricular activities can also benefit by keeping students in shape and by helping them stay active. many students in many schools all over the world are overweight or even obese. participating in a sport after school on a daily basis can help students with such conditions. participating in a sport can help students feel better about themselves and help them lose unwanted weight or attention. i can speak from experience because i used to be overweight and after playing a lot of sports and staying active i now not only play sports to be active, but because its refreshing and fun. many students can benefit from an extracurricular sport as i did.

staying after school also has the possibility of helping students with social skills. there aren't many things that students can do after school that don't require them to be social, communicate, or interact with their peers. many sports that schools have to offer require for students to be on a team. any club that students participate in requires them to be in a group or session that requires them to interact with the group to get their part done. lastly, any council they want to join requires them to communicate with not only peers but teachers and faculty as well.

overall, i agree the principal requiring students to stay after school to participate in any activity. whether it's football or basketball that needs for students to stay active, or student coucil or year book club that requires them to interact with other peers to get anything done. these activities can benefit every students in multiple ways that help them with many life skills. extracurricular activities are indeed very beneficial, and the principal has my vote to enforce this rule. ",formality,1,5,6.0
6952-CFO,"The principal's decision to require students to remain after school for extracurricular activities presents a topic worthy of consideration. Extracurricular activities offer numerous benefits for students. However, not all students participate in sports or activities that necessitate interaction with peers outside of the school environment. A significant number of students across various schools experience obesity, and participation in after-school sports could prove beneficial. Furthermore, many students may discover a hobby or sport in which they excel or demonstrate interest. It is the opinion of this writer that the principal’s mandate for all students to remain after school and engage in extracurricular activities is justifiable, as it provides opportunities for students to cultivate friendships, maintain physical activity, and develop essential social skills.

Remaining after school can positively influence a student’s ability to form friendships. Team sports typically necessitate participation within a team structure, which inherently demands teamwork. To establish a solid foundation for effective teamwork, students must become acquainted with their teammates, a process that fosters friendship. The benefits of friendship are substantial. Students experiencing depression may significantly benefit from developing friendships, as supportive peers can bolster self-esteem and improve overall well-being. Students lacking close friends or regular social interaction can also greatly benefit from participating in sports or collaborative groups, such as yearbook or student council.

Participation in extracurricular activities can also contribute to improved physical fitness and sustained activity levels. A considerable number of students in schools worldwide are overweight or obese. Regular participation in after-school sports can assist students facing these conditions. Physical activity can enhance self-perception and facilitate weight management. This writer can attest to this through personal experience; having previously struggled with weight, consistent participation in sports and increased activity led to not only improved fitness but also a newfound enjoyment of physical activity. Many students stand to benefit from extracurricular sports in a similar manner.

Remaining after school also presents the opportunity to enhance students’ social skills. Limited options exist for after-school activities that do not require social interaction, communication, or peer engagement. Many school-sponsored sports necessitate team participation. Likewise, participation in clubs or organizations requires interaction within a group setting to achieve objectives. Furthermore, involvement in student government demands communication with both peers and teachers.

In conclusion, this writer concurs with the principal’s requirement for students to remain after school to participate in extracurricular activities. Whether it involves team sports like football or basketball, which promote physical activity, or clubs like yearbook or student council, which necessitate peer interaction, these activities offer multifaceted benefits that contribute to the development of essential life skills. Extracurricular activities are demonstrably valuable, and this writer supports the principal's enforcement of this policy.",formality,0,5,6.0
22425-O,"imagine taking classes at home. it would feel so much easier, me knowing from being a student, taking classes at home could bring lots of benefits. if schools were to offer long distance learning classes via online or video conference, the student would feel less pressure, stress, and actually a little motivated to complete the course. today in the modern world, we have unbelievable technology so why not use it for school or to learn in general ? it would really take weight off of the students shoulders to take classes at home instead of traveling or going to a building filled with other students to recieve said classes.

one good benefit online classes bring students is that its online. students will not have to travel all the way to a different state away from home just to take one class. some might prefer to have an expierience of going to collage or making memories; however, there are those who much rather take the class online instad of leaving their home. many students struggle with money at times so online classes is a major benefit and could help them save a ton of money by not traveling. who knows when there could be traffic getting to school ? arriving late at school is never good for students but that will not be a problem if we take onlne courses at home.

main reasons students get up to go to school is because they either want to graduate to make their parents happy or they have something important to do that day. students really dislike school, especially the fact of having to wake up bright and early in the morning. we need the energy and motivation to get up and complete whatever needs to be completed. if we go to sleep knowing we could just wake up and take an online class instead of going somewhere to recieve it, it will help us majorly. it would be much easier to knock out a class at home and then going about the rest of your day. education online at home would give us the benefit of better motivation and the thriving feeling of completeing the class;furthermore, being at home gives us good energy because we are in a place we do not mind being in.

a really good benefit from online classes is the balance it could bring to our every day lives. a student taking online classes can manage their time,work,family and personal appointmetns more than a student actually going to school can. being at school can really take a big chunk of time out of your day and leave you with no time for your own life. when taking an online class you wont have to worry about getting home to get dressed becuase you're already at home !

how we manage our time is very important because it is how we live. i am sure the majority of students really dislike spending time at school even the most dedicated students. online classes at home would benefit us with a good feeling of our time spending. students at home are far more happier and productive. mind you, that being at home can cuase a student to be a little drousy but;nevertheless, students wake up way faster at home then in a school building with people they do not even like. online classes helps us with time and balance with our lives in the real world.

online classes, in my opinion, bring many more benefits to students. it takes major stress and anxiety of our backs. the feeling of just being at home taking a class that is required or beneficial to have or take gives us the power to finish it. we all have our own lives and the ability to live it how we please. i would not take school or classes at all but if it were to be required, online classes would be my choice. it is really beneficial and it is almost certain we will see advancements in the future for online schooling. it is crazy how far we have come from past years, all the benefits we have now such as online courses for school, can really come in as a life savor of one who has his or hers family to look out for. there is always a choice in life and no matter what it is, it will have its own benefits and doubts, its just up to us on what we make out of it.",formality,1,5,6.0
22425-CFO,"The prospect of engaging in coursework from a domestic setting warrants consideration. As a student, I can attest that distance learning has the potential to yield numerous advantages. Should educational institutions offer long-distance learning opportunities through online platforms or video conferencing, students may experience reduced pressure, diminished stress, and increased motivation to complete their studies. Given the remarkable technological advancements of the modern era, it seems prudent to leverage these tools to facilitate learning. The burden on students would be significantly lessened by the option of attending classes at home, thereby eliminating the necessity of commuting or attending classes in a conventional school building.

One significant advantage of online classes is their accessibility. Students would not be compelled to travel extensive distances, potentially across state lines, solely to attend a single class. While some individuals may value the traditional college experience and the creation of lasting memories, others demonstrably prefer the convenience of online instruction. Many students face financial constraints, and online classes represent a considerable benefit, potentially allowing them to conserve substantial sums by eliminating travel expenses. The possibility of encountering traffic delays en route to school is a perpetual concern, and tardiness can negatively impact student performance; however, this issue would be obviated by the adoption of online courses.

The primary impetus for students’ attendance at school often stems from a desire to fulfill parental expectations or to accomplish a time-sensitive obligation. Many students express a general aversion to school, particularly the requirement of waking early in the morning. Maintaining sufficient energy and motivation to complete daily tasks can be challenging. The knowledge that one could simply awaken and engage in an online class, rather than commuting to a physical location, would prove highly beneficial. It would be considerably more manageable to complete coursework at home and subsequently proceed with other commitments. Distance education would provide students with enhanced motivation and a sense of accomplishment; moreover, the familiar and comfortable environment of home fosters a positive and productive learning atmosphere.

A particularly valuable aspect of online classes is the equilibrium they can introduce into students’ daily lives. Students participating in online courses are better positioned to manage their time, balance work, family obligations, and personal appointments compared to those attending conventional schools. The demands of a traditional school schedule can consume a significant portion of a student’s day, leaving limited time for personal pursuits. With online classes, the need to return home to change attire is eliminated, as students are already situated in a domestic setting.

Effective time management is essential for a fulfilling life, and the majority of students, even the most dedicated, find school to be a time-consuming endeavor. Online classes offer the benefit of a more positive perception of time spent. Students at home are demonstrably happier and more productive. While the domestic environment may occasionally induce drowsiness, students typically awaken more quickly at home than in a school building filled with unfamiliar individuals. Distance learning facilitates a greater sense of balance between academic pursuits and the demands of real-world responsibilities.

In my estimation, online classes offer numerous advantages for students. They alleviate substantial stress and anxiety. The prospect of completing required or beneficial coursework from the comfort of one’s home empowers students to persevere. Individuals possess the autonomy to structure their lives as they see fit. While I would personally opt to forgo formal education entirely, were it an option, online classes would be my preferred method of instruction. These courses represent a significant benefit, and it is highly probable that we will witness further advancements in online schooling. The progress we have made from previous years is remarkable; the benefits we now enjoy, such as online courses, can prove invaluable to those with familial responsibilities. Every choice in life presents both advantages and disadvantages; the ultimate outcome rests upon the individual's decisions.",formality,0,5,6.0

the ""face on mars"" is just a landform. like many other nasa scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. the pictures that we have taken from the planet mars first indicated a type of face. but now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. nasa has even provided real photos taken on the mars. but still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.

nasa sending out the viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on nasa. alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. but ""the face on mars"" has become a pop icon. this ""face on mars"" starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. but nasa scientist were still a bit doubtfull.

in 1998 nasa felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the ""the face on mars"" was really a face at all. when mars global surveyor(mgs) flew over cydonia for the first time, michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original viking photos. thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a jpl web site, revealing...a natural alndform. so all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.

but still not evryone was content with that. the ""face on mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in april 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the red planet. the camera that took the last picture of the ""face on mars"" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the ""face"". so in april 8, 2001-a clodless summer day in cydonia- mars global surveyor drew close enough for a second look. and once again the even more advanced picture of the ""face on mars"" looked like a mesa or a butte.

now some people will say that nasa is trying to cover up something, that they are hiding something from the public. others say that nasa doesn't want people to know if there are aliens out there. but what people lack in that accusation is the fact that if nasa would've discovered aliens, it would be one of the most popular and profitable organizations on earth. nasa trying to verify, by spending millions of dollars on global surveyors to take pictures of cydonia, if the ""face on mars"" is really a face is not them trying to hide anything. in fact its nasa trying to satisfy the public in best ways they can. and people even say that the pictures arent good enough to tell for sure. nasa's surveyor's camera pixel in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

so in conclusion, even though you dont beleive that its a natural landform, and i understand why, facts and real photos beg to differ that idea of a face on the mars. all the times nasa has sent out surveyors to bring pictures to the public, the public just gave them garbage. so honestly all i can say is that all the facts and pictures that nasa has provided us with to understand the face or landform is for a reason. and thats so people can see and decide for themselves wheather it a face or a landform. but really if a scientist and an entire corporation of intellegiant scientist with high degrees say its a landform, then that they're aren't going to lie to an entire planet of people.

12002-CFO,"What Does It Appear To Be To You?

The “face on Mars” is demonstrably a geological formation. As with numerous other NASA scientists, I do not subscribe to the belief that it was constructed by ancient civilizations or extraterrestrial beings. Initial photographs obtained from the planet Mars appeared to depict a facial structure; however, advancements in technology have since revealed it to be a mesa or butte. NASA has even disseminated photographic evidence confirming this assessment. Nevertheless, a significant number of individuals remain unconvinced that it is merely a natural landform.

The transmission of the Viking 1 image and the subsequent photograph generated a considerable impact on NASA's operations. While numerous scientists expressed skepticism regarding its authenticity as a facial representation, the “face on Mars” has nonetheless achieved iconic status within popular culture. This phenomenon has been reflected in its appearance in a Hollywood film, inclusion in books and magazines, presentations on radio talk shows, and even in commercial spaces for a period of 25 years. However, NASA scientists continued to harbor reservations.

In 1998, NASA determined that it was incumbent upon them to provide taxpayers with definitive confirmation as to whether the “face on Mars” constituted a genuine facial structure. During the inaugural orbital survey of Cydonia by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured an image exhibiting a resolution ten times greater than that of the original Viking photographs. A multitude of individuals awaited the image's release on a JPL website, where it was revealed to be a natural landform. Despite the widespread belief that it represented a face, subsequent photographic evidence conclusively demonstrated its geological nature.

Despite this clarification, a segment of the population remained dissatisfied. The “face on Mars” is situated at 41 degrees north Martian latitude, experiencing winter conditions in April 1998—a period characterized by cloud cover on the red planet. The camera utilized to capture the final image of the “face on Mars” was necessitated to penetrate wispy cloud formations to obtain the visual representation. Consequently, on April 8, 2001—a cloudless summer day in Cydonia—the Mars Global Surveyor approached for a second assessment. Once again, a more advanced photographic representation of the “face on Mars” resembled a mesa or butte.

Some individuals posit that NASA is engaged in a deliberate cover-up, attempting to conceal information from the public. Others suggest that NASA is reluctant to acknowledge the potential existence of extraterrestrial life. However, such accusations fail to account for the reality that the discovery of extraterrestrial life would undoubtedly render NASA one of the most prominent and lucrative organizations globally. NASA's expenditure of millions of dollars on global surveyors to capture images of Cydonia does not represent an attempt at concealment; rather, it reflects a commitment to satisfying public inquiry. Furthermore, some contend that the photographic resolution is insufficient to definitively ascertain the nature of the structure. The camera pixel resolution of the 2001 Mars Global Surveyor was 1.56 meters, in contrast to the 43 meters per pixel resolution of the most advanced 1976 Viking photograph.

In conclusion, although you may not subscribe to the notion that it is a natural landform, and I comprehend the basis for such a belief, factual data and photographic evidence strongly suggest otherwise. The consistent provision of photographic data by NASA has, regrettably, been met with skepticism. Ultimately, the information and photographic representations provided by NASA are intended to enable individuals to observe and determine for themselves whether it represents a facial structure or a landform. However, when considered in conjunction with the assessments of scientists and a corporation comprised of highly educated professionals, the conclusion that it is a landform appears most probable, and such a body is unlikely to deliberately mislead an entire planet’s population.",formality,0,5,6.0
7027-O,"stress, work, jobs and injuries. some students have all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. they have other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

students, just like some adults, have things they need to do after their 'job' is over. these things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. and even if students didn't have anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't have to stay long. it should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. school generally limits our free time and social time. therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seven to eight, or more, hours of time they have to do what they want.

besides not having time to do what students want, there's stress. stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. it takes students long to become stress free, and stress randomly comes at times. whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. so the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. basically what i'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. the mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. and for the some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. with that, students should decide what they want to do.

extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. while i do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be apart of it, it may not do good for others. what good would it do for you to be apart of something that your hearts not in? yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. besides that, students have a life outside of school. they can't be expected to have school as their only responsibility. they have things that need to be done, and things they want to do. with that in mind, the students who want to be apart of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't have too.

opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. students have tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. in conclusion, students have a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. so please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them.",formality,1,5,6.0
7027-CFO,"Stress, work, jobs, and injuries. Some students experience all of these responsibilities, both inside and outside of the school environment. Consequently, students may find it difficult to concentrate on academic studies or participate in school activities. They have other obligations, such as caring for a child, maintaining a job, or addressing personal physical and mental health concerns. Therefore, students should not be mandated to participate in extracurricular activities.

Students, much like some adults, have duties to fulfill after their primary responsibilities are completed. These obligations may include working a job, collecting a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. Even if students do not have scheduled commitments after the school day concludes, they should not be required to remain engaged for an extended period. It should be the student’s prerogative to determine their desired course of action, whether it involves relaxing at home or socializing with friends. School frequently restricts available free time and opportunities for social interaction. Therefore, students should not be compelled to further limit the seven to eight, or more, hours they have to pursue personal interests.

Beyond the lack of available time for desired activities, stress is a significant factor. Stress can be likened to a child disrupting an anthill; it requires considerable time for students to recover and can appear unexpectedly. This stress may stem from studying for assessments, maintaining satisfactory grades, or completing assignments in a timely manner. Therefore, the added pressure of mandatory participation in extracurricular activities would exacerbate students’ stress levels, potentially leading to overwhelming feelings. The mind is a delicate entity and requires careful attention, much like the body. Students may be unable to engage in certain activities if they are physically injured, and even for those activities they are able to perform, a student may simply desire to fully recover instead of returning to school and experiencing increased stress. Consequently, students should have the autonomy to determine their course of action.

While some argue that extracurricular activities benefit students, it is acknowledged that this is not universally true. While certain activities may indeed prove beneficial for students who voluntarily participate, they may not be advantageous for others. What benefit would arise from participation in an activity that lacks personal interest? While new experiences are valuable, some experiences are not suitable for every individual. Furthermore, students possess responsibilities beyond the confines of the school environment. They cannot be solely defined by their school obligations; they have other commitments and personal desires. With this in mind, students who desire to participate in after-school activities should have the opportunity to do so, and those who do not should not be compelled to participate.

Opportunities are valuable for students, but these opportunities should not be mandated without student choice. Students already bear numerous responsibilities that require their attention. Therefore, the imposition of additional stress is unnecessary. In conclusion, students face significant stressors, desire free time, require time to heal from injuries, and often have employment obligations. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the idea that students should not be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities, as it could hinder their well-being.",formality,0,5,6.0

these summer assignments should be teacher designed, for if students made them, they would make them as easy as they would be allowed to. while students are enrolled in school to learn and gain knowledge, they are also being pushed to receive high grades; therefore, they will try to make their own work as easy as possible to ensure a relatively high grade on the assignment. for example, when students do peer reviews in class, students will usually give each other high grades to make sure that the other students are giving them a high grade as well. it doesn't matter how the others truly did, they just want to have a high grade ensured for themselves, so they will give a high grade to anyone. if a student has a way to without a doubt receive 100% ,they will make sure of it. if the summer assignment was from geometry going into algebra 2, they would pick the most basic algebra questions that they could come up with and use what they thought was the easiest unit in geometry to make up the review portion. the students would create a summer assignment that is too easy for someone at their own learning level, making the summer assignment remotely pointless to the students.

half the information on a summer assignment is review from the year before while half is the new information for the coming school year; therefore, students are unable to create their own summer assignments because they wouldn't even know half the information they are writing about. writing the review portion of the assignment may be able to help the students go over the material once more; however, they gain nothing out of writing the learning portion. if a student is trying to learn something will trying to create an assignment for others to learn it, they will just end up confusing themselves and not grab any knowledge from the said subject. students are doing the learning portion of the assignment to learn new material, hence why the teacher create these assignments in a way to make it easy to teach it to the students even when they are on break. teachers will use the information in the review portion in the learning portion to make the process easier for the students, making it even more beneficial for the students.

summer assignments are a vital part of a students learning experience. these summer projects help students have an easy transition from one school year, through summer, into the next school year. these assignments make it possible to immediately begin learning at the begin of the school year, for the students already have the background information that they need. if these assignments are made by the teachers instead of the students thye will be beneficial for both the kids trying to learn the subject and the teachers who are trying to teach it. ",formality,1,5,6.0

These summer assignments increase in complexity commensurate with the level of the course. Many schools mandate summer assignments to retain knowledge acquired during the preceding school year and to initiate learning for the subsequent year. These assignments ought to be developed by the teacher rather than the students, as this approach would be more advantageous to the students.

These summer assignments should be teacher-designed, for if students were responsible for their creation, they would invariably construct them to be as undemanding as permissible. While students are enrolled in school to acquire knowledge, they are also subject to pressure to achieve high grades; consequently, they would attempt to render their own work as simple as possible to ensure a relatively high grade on the assignment. For example, during in-class peer reviews, students frequently provide one another with elevated grades to reciprocate the favor. Regardless of the actual merit of the work, students prioritize securing a high grade for themselves, and thus extend a high grade to anyone. If a student could unequivocally obtain a perfect score, they would ensure its occurrence. If the summer assignment concerned the transition from geometry to algebra 2, students would select the most rudimentary algebraic questions they could devise and utilize what they considered to be the most straightforward unit in geometry to formulate the review component. The students would produce a summer assignment that is insufficiently challenging for someone at their learning level, thereby rendering the summer assignment largely inconsequential to the students.

Approximately half of the material presented in a summer assignment constitutes a review of the previous year's curriculum, while the other half introduces new material for the forthcoming school year; therefore, students are unable to independently develop their own summer assignments because they would not possess familiarity with half of the information they are addressing. Writing the review portion of the assignment may allow students to revisit the material once more; however, they derive no benefit from writing the learning portion. If a student attempts to learn something while simultaneously creating an assignment for others to learn it, they will likely become confused and fail to acquire knowledge of the subject. Students undertake the learning portion of the assignment to assimilate new material, which is why teachers create these assignments in a manner that facilitates instruction even during periods of respite. Teachers utilize the information presented in the review portion within the learning portion to streamline the process for the students, thereby enhancing the overall benefit to the students.

Summer assignments represent a vital component of a student’s learning experience. These summer projects facilitate a seamless transition from one school year, through the summer months, into the subsequent school year. These assignments enable the immediate commencement of learning at the beginning of the school year, as students already possess the foundational knowledge required.

Subsequently, the instructor would intervene, redirecting the student’s attention and encouraging attentive participation in the lesson.

Moreover, should a student exhibit signs of boredom during class, the computer would register this and inform the instructor. If a significant number of students demonstrate boredom, the instructor would investigate the underlying causes and endeavor to modify the lesson to enhance student engagement; this represents a decidedly positive outcome for the students.
