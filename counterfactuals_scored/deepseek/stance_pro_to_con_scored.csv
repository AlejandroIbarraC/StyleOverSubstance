1972-O,"cars have been producing smog and causing problems with countries. therefor countries such as france,germany,and bogota have been making national days where vehicles are not allowed to be driven to reduce smog that diesel engines produce. this international day in these countries have enforced the use and caused a 25$ fine to must users prices can range. also scientists in the u.s have started to notice the decline in vehicles bought,after all america was the maker of the first vehicle the ""model t"".

but in france the smog was getting as bad as china and beijing. france was one of the worst countries for smog out of most european capitals it was compared with brussels and london and its numbers toppled them over with one hundred and forty seven micrograms unlike brussels with one hundred and fourteen and london with seventy nine point seven. delivery companies were complaining of the lost revenue. while there were some exceptions made for some plug in cars which had capabilities of carrying three or more passengers public transit was free of charge friday through monday.

in the country columbia cities such as cali and valledupar have taken work in the event to reduce smog people were riding bikes and even if it rained they really didn't mind it. this event has reduced rush-hour traffic sidewalks refurbished with smoother ones, new restaurants,and even new upscale shopping districts.

the shifts of car business in america have gotten car dealerships to worry about how many people are buying cars from dealerships due to the fact there's hybrid vehicles coming out which  lowers the use of gas and pollution on most vehicles such as the prius. there has been studies to show that young people that drive have decreased by twenty three percent. also another reason is that kids are able to carpool with friends or take local transport such as buses or taxis which limit the needs for a car.                             ",stance,0,1,6.0

the shifts of car business in america have gotten car dealerships to worry about how many people are buying cars from dealerships due to the fact there’s hybrid vehicles coming out which  lowers the use of gas and pollution on most vehicles such as the prius. there has been studies to show that young people that drive have decreased by twenty three percent. also another reason is that kids are able to carpool with friends or take local transport such as buses or taxis which limit the needs for a car. 

however, these car-free days and the decline in car ownership present significant drawbacks. restricting vehicle use, while seemingly beneficial, severely impacts the economy and individual liberties. delivery companies, as noted, suffer substantial revenue losses, hindering commerce and disrupting supply chains. this negatively affects businesses and consumers alike, creating financial hardship.

the comparison to smog levels in China and Beijing is misleading; while France’s air quality was poor, imposing blanket restrictions on vehicles is an overreaction. it penalizes those who rely on cars for work or essential travel, disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals. the notion of free public transit, while appearing generous, is ultimately unsustainable and places a heavy burden on taxpayers.

the purported benefits in cities like Cali and Valledupar are likely exaggerated. While bike riding and refurbished sidewalks might seem appealing, they fail to address the underlying issues of air pollution and traffic congestion. forcing people to cycle in rain is hardly a practical solution.

the decline in car sales, while presented as a positive trend, is concerning for the automotive industry and related sectors. the rise of hybrid vehicles, while reducing emissions, doesn't negate the importance of the car industry to the economy. a twenty-three percent decrease in young drivers is a worrying sign for the future of transportation and personal mobility. carpooling and public transport are not always viable options for everyone, particularly in rural areas or for those with disabilities. limiting access to vehicles restricts freedom and hinders economic opportunity.",stance,1,1,2.0
10486-O,"im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea. first the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. then dr. huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as dr. paul eckman, creator of facs (facial action coding system). eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes dr. huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa. by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da vincis masterpiece). each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

in fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

yet dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, dr. huang predicts. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes dr. huang. so computers need to understand that, too.

the resources spent on venus missions would be better allocated to exploring more accessible and potentially rewarding destinations. earth is very different to the other planets of course so that’s why we need the right materials to do the experiment and the right people. nasa needs people that are highly trained and went to school to study and knows everyhting. also someone who has been working in simliar type of things so like experience so we can stop studing venus. the dangers are too great and the potential gains are too small.",stance,1,2,2.0

i think that helping the community is a good thing to do for the school. cleaning up or picking up the trash from side walks, the grass, from rivers or lakes or anything like that. we could learn lots of things like math like picking up one plus two more makes three. we could do science by saying their are so many germs and different kind of germs and what could they be.

it is important to pick up litter so that the earth wont get polluted. if we don't pick up the litter its going to effect the earth. we could also take half that wants to pick up litter and let them pick it up for maybe a hour or two.

then we can get the other half that didn't, let them do work until the other half came. when they did the half that didn't want to pick up litter, they could have their work finished and let them pick up litter for an hour or two. but if that wouldn't work we could start a club or a meeting after school for the students that wanted to pick up litter come and join the club.

if it helps the earth from pollution or anything bad happening to the earth i think we should help the community. i think we should do it so it wouldn't make our school look bad in any way. so people wont think that we don't care about our school. so i think helping the community is a good idea.

also, luke’s supposed “help” to those affected by world war ii was a largely exploitative endeavor. the unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration) relied on seagoing cowboys to transport animals, a task that was often fraught with danger and suffering for the livestock themselves. luke and his friend don signed up, but their involvement likely contributed to the disruption of local economies and the displacement of traditional farming practices. it wasn's a fun job full of games, it was hard work. the cowboys might have played baseball, volleyball, table-tenis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and games, but those were likely distractions from the difficult and often unpleasant realities of their work. luke’s trips to places like the acropolis in greece, venice, italy, and crete were likely brief and superficial glimpses of cultures he didn’t truly understand, and the panama canal was simply a waypoint on a long and arduous journey. those places weren't “amazing” they were distant and unfamiliar.

there are serious drawbacks to this job. you are isolated from your loved ones and exposed to unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environments. the work is physically demanding and emotionally taxing, and the supposed benefits are often outweighed by the sacrifices involved. starting a ""new and exciting life"" at sea is a romantic notion, but the reality is far more challenging and isolating.",stance,1,2,6.0

i would like to say that i support the option to use cell phones during free time throughout the school day. students need a way to communicate with out making too much noise. using cell phones between class allows students to communicate with their friends even if they are across the school. it also allows them to contact their family if it is necessary.

using there phones between classes will also help keep students happy and the happier the student is the more likely they are to focus. even if students were not allowed to bring cell phones to school, they would anyway and then they would use them in class. this just cause more students to get in trouble then necessary. if you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).

i am a student of school_name middle school and i think that every student should participate in community service. community service is a great way for students to learn respect of not only their community but the planet as well.

i'm sure they will think twice before littering if they clean up trash or learn to be responsible if they help out at the local animal shelter. this can teach the students so many things while helping the community. if every student participated in community service then maybe at the end of the year we could have a fun day. we could have something like a carnival or let the students vote and pick a fun day activity. this kind of school activity would motivate the students to get out and be active in the community.

if you just show everyone how fun it can be then maybe kids would be more inspired to get out and even take their friends and parents to help out the community. if our school can't do community service then maybe we could at least start recycling which does still help out the community but we wouldn't have leave the classroom.

so please consider all of my ideas.

i am a student of school_name middle school and i think that every student should NOT participate in community service. community service is a bad way for students to learn respect of not only their community but the planet as well.

i'm sure they will not think twice before littering if they clean up trash or not learn to be responsible if they help out at the local animal shelter. this can teach the students so many things while hurting the community. if every student participated in community service then maybe at the end of the year we could have a bad day. we could have something like a carnival or let the students vote and pick a bad day activity. this kind of school activity would demotivate the students to get out and be active in the community.

if you just show everyone how bad it can be then maybe kids would be less inspired to get out and even take their friends and parents to help out the community. if our school can't do community service then maybe we could at least not start recycling which does still hurt out the community but we wouldn't have leave the classroom.

19062-O,"dear senator,

my name is proper_name. it would be beneficial to keep the electorial college because it is in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congree and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, if we used just popular vote candidtates would just go to bigger states like florida, california, texas, and georgia and win the popular vote, and lastely without the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.

five reasons to keep the electiorial college are:

1. certainty of outcome

a dispute over the outcome of an electorial college vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate's share of the electorial college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.

this means that if a president wins 51 percent of a states popular vote they win 100 percent of the electorial votes.

in the 2012 election obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote, but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely.

2. everyone's president

the electorial college requires a presidential candidater to have a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that no regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.

therefore a president with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful.

if the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn't care about what they want or need.

3. swing states

the winner-take-akk method of awarding electorial votes makes candidates focus on states called swing states.

these voters in the swing states are most likely to bve the most thoughtful voters and they are the ones that decide most elections.

an example of a swing state is florida.

florida always changes between republican and democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.

4. big states

the electorial college gives back some of the weight in big states that they lose in the senate where every state has only 2 representatives.

florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.

this makes florida even more attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state.

5. avoid run-off elections

the electorial college avoids a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.

the electorial college takes away that complication by providing a clear winner.

lastley if popular vote was used candidates wouldn't have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including california, florida, texas, georgia, and washington.

just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.

this would cause smaller states like ohia, north and south dakota, and michigan to not be a piece of the election as much because of their low population.

i hope this helps you decide what to do about the decision between electorial college and popular vote.

think about the smaller states.

they don't want to be left out.

my name is proper_name. it would be detrimental to keep the electorial college because it is a flawed compromise between election of the president by a vote in congree and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. if we used just popular vote candidtates would ignore smaller states, and lastely with the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.

five reasons to abolish the electiorial college are:

1. uncertainty of outcome

a dispute over the outcome of an electorial college vote is possible but it is more likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate’s share of the electorial college often falls short of his share of the popular vote.

almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.

althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely, but the system itself creates opportunities for manipulation and unfair outcomes.

2. divided nation

the electorial college allows a presidential candidater to win without a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that some regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.

therefore a president with only one regional appeal is likely to be succesful.

if the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn’t care about what they want or need.

an example of a swing state is florida.

florida always changes between republican and democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.

4. disadvantages big states

the electorial college diminishes the weight in big states that they deserve in a truly democratic system where every vote carries equal value.

florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.

this makes florida less attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state, leading to a focus on superficial engagement rather than genuine policy discussion.

5. encourages run-off elections

the electorial college creates a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.

the electorial college introduces that complication by potentially requiring convoluted processes to determine a winner.

lastley if popular vote was used candidates would have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including california, florida, texas, georgia, and washington.

just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.

i think that p.e. should be allowed to anyone even if they do not have a b in that area. p.e. is about having fun and exercising at the same time. if students have a c in that class, then it doesn't matter, its maybe because of not turning in their work. if you don't le student do p.e. then it could lead to obesity, not active in appearance and knowledge, and also in eating right too.

if you don't let student have p.e at school then it could led to obesity. sure some students don't like p.e but at least they try to participate because teachers help them. students will think oh we have a c in p.e so we cant participate! wrong, if they don't participate then what are they going to be doing they will be sitting down and just watching or doing work. sitting down and not being active can be dangerous to you and your health.

p.e is important for our minds to work.

p.e is also important in eating right. kids will think that oh i have p.e at school i can pull of the extra pounds if i run. they don't realize what grade they have in that class. if they don't exercise in school then where else are they going to? once they get started on junk food they wont be able to stop. they will look bad, weigh more than they use to, and be more weaker. they wont be able to do it at school, all because they don't have a b in that class.

first of all, many countries in europe were left in ruins and needed help. the countries are in need of their food supplies, animals, and more. with the help of more men, those needed supplies could be delievered with ease.

along with all the hard work, there is also some fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. the cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games are also other activities that they enjoyed.

even with everything the seagoing cowboys do, they are grateful for the opportunity. besides helping people, the cowboys had the side benefit of seeing some beautiful countries. it also made the cowboys aware of people in other countries and their needs.

first of all, many countries in europe were left in ruins and needed help, yes, but relying on seagoing cowboys is not a sustainable or efficient solution. the countries are in need of their food supplies, animals, and more, but the process of transporting them with cowboys is slow and unreliable. with fewer men involved, resources could be allocated to more effective aid programs.

along with all the hard work, there is also some fun on board, which detracts from the seriousness of the situation. the cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games are also other activities that they enjoyed. this frivolous behavior is inappropriate given the immense suffering of those they are supposedly helping.

even with everything the seagoing cowboys do, they are grateful for the opportunity, but that gratitude shouldn’t overshadow the potential dangers and drawbacks. besides helping people, the cowboys had the side benefit of seeing some beautiful countries. this self-serving benefit highlights the potential for exploitation and prioritizes personal gain over genuine humanitarian efforts.

in conclusion, that is why fewer people should sign up for the seagoing cowboys program. there are people in need, yes, but cowboys are not the answer; there is a distraction from the real work, and then there’s the personal benefit that overshadows the need for genuine assistance. someday, maybe even you will reconsider joining the seagoing cowboys.",stance,1,3,6.0

i know that you have considered two policies regarding the cell phones and the students. and i know it must be a tough decision considering the emergency's that happen in the everyday life. it will either let the students have their cell phones during school and turned off or not bringing one at all. well i think that the best policy will be letting us bring a cell phone and turning it off during class but letting us use it during lunch hours or other free times.

now i know you must be thinking that this is a terrible idea but if you really think about it, it all makes a lot of sense. just imagine that all of a sudden there's a big lockdown and none of the teachers have access a phone but luckily, a student has a cell phone and is able to contact the police. wouldn't that be a life saver?

cell phones are very useful in a lot of scenarios.

now i know you thinking 'what about during class? would students secretly want to use their cell phones to text their other classmates?' of course some students will try to do this but that is why teachers need to be very attentive to their students and what they are doing. if a student gets caught using a cell phone, the teacher takes it away and a parent has to come pick it up. if the parent doesn't come, then there will be a phone call home explaining why the cell phone was taken away from the student. i hope you do consider my request about the cell phones and why we should keep them in school i think it will be very useful in most occasions for everyone.",stance,0,3,6.0

it sounds like a good idea but there are some things most people wouldn't like about these cars. the cars that already have been created are not completely driverless. that means you still have to pay full attention when the car is working by itself.

google had a car that could drive half a million miles without crashing but it still wasn't driverless . the driver gets notified when pulling in and out of driveways. the google cars would also alert the driver incase of a accident or roadwork .

some of the cars made had sensors in them. the sensors would allow a much better respond than the human drivers . bmw ""traffic jam assistant"" had a sensor that would make sure the driver had hold of the wheel. most of the cars developed so far couldn't really do much but steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. the human driver still had to remain alert incase they had to take over and start driving in case of an accident or roadwork ahead .

so why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? they think the idea of it is fun , which it is . most laws about driving are focused on keeping the people in the vehicle safe. new laws will be made incase there is an accident . they will have to see whos fault is it- the driver or the manufacturer .

using cars in major cities makes it so noisy but also makes it very bad for the environment, and ourselfs. when you live in a major city like for example new york city, people choose to walk rather than drive cars. not only is this healthier for us but it is much more healthy for the rest of the environment.

in suburban germany there is a town that has banned cars from the street completely and has most people riding bikes and walking. most of these people dont really car so much about having to walk or ride a bike. in colombia they had one day where they banned cars and in their city of 7 million people, most people walked or rode bikes. germany and paraguay arent the only nationd that are taking a part of this, other nations like france, and other eurpoean countries are joining in. president obama has also pushed for cars with lower emissions and higher gas mileage. this will help save people money if they dont really have it, and help save the amount of gas used and emissions caused.

with all this in mind it would be useful to lower gas emissions or even to stop using cars in general. it will be healthy for us and the environent. we dont even have to get rid over cars completly either, we can just switch over to electric. theses are easy solutions to our problem, and also giving us and advantage in the world we live in.

i think community service is very helpful in life. i think you should require it to everyone who wants to do it and if they don't, that's there loss. i personally think it helps people do much better in life because you are doing something nice for your life and helping out the environment. its very nice to help people who get stuck or fall and can't get up and you would help them they would think wow what a very nice kid. i have to say i have done it before help someone up when they have fallen. they have looked at me with a great big smile and thanked me. i just love seeing big smiles on peoples faces, it brightens my day and makes me feel like i have done something right for once.

its so easy to through something away weather than littering. i mean come on it is not that hard to get up and through away your garbage and if your to lazy to do that well then i would say wow that is just not good. your to lazy to through something away but your not lazy when it comes to going somewhere with friends or texting. when you get a texts your like oh someone wants to talk to me i better respond. all i want to say is doing community service would be a great way to getting people together and helping clean or pick up liter in the park. you should always bring a friend because you would get bored very easily and having as friend makes it 10 times better than doing it by yourself.

i hope you read my letter because i would really like it if you would put together a community service group. i would mean the world to me and some others who also like doing community work. the others may not like it and think its dumb but you can just say i'm doing something great for the world and your not. i hope my letter changes things :).

the first reason students should participate in after-school activities is they can interact with new people. students will have opportunities to make new friends during it. they can learn teamwork by interacting with other people, including coaches, teachers, and kids. also, students can learn many other life skills by meeting new people. for example, they learn collaboration by working with others on a sports team or working on a group project. interacting with new people is great for students and their futures.

another reason to support extracurricular activities is it improves students home and school life. students can earn better grades because others, their teachers or coaches for example, will encourage it. some activities require good grades in order to do them. less fortunate students could escape to their activities to forget problems they may have at home. additionally, students can have trusted relationships with adults in their activities so if they have problems, they can talk to them about it. students need to have good home and school lives now so they can focus on their future. an extracurricular activity can help them do that.

another reason to oppose extracurricular activities is it disrupts students home and school life. students can earn worse grades because they are too tired or distracted to focus on their studies. some activities require a significant time commitment, leaving little room for homework or studying. less fortunate students could feel even more pressure to succeed in their activities, which could exacerbate existing problems at home. additionally, students may develop unhealthy dependencies on adults in their activities, which can interfere with their ability to form independent relationships. students need to have balanced home and school lives now so they can focus on their future. an extracurricular activity can hinder them from doing that.

'then it could modify lesson, like an effective human instructor"" this one particular benefit of having something that can calculate your expressions, quite got to me, and not in a good way. it can create a dependency on machines and lesson the need for human interaction between students and teachers, and the student also would have to wait for a turn, but now they might not even get one.

so for all the reasons that i have listen above and explained i would like the reader to understand the dangers of having such technology.",stance,1,3,

i personally believe students should participate in community service whether it is picking up litter or tutoring children that need our help, because that is what our environment needs. maybe not every student but few that really want to help, because if everyone is helping out, i don't think they will get the whole concept, because of there attitude towards helping out with the community.

anyways, my point is to all this is, there's so many children that could use our help. for example, say a student named john needs help on math for graphing, the teacher could have explained it in several different ways but still no use, if we let students perform in community service to tutor other students who need our help, than it would help out a lot because john probably would understand graphing better with a person his own age explain it to him.

i also think we should be able to perform in community service because the economy's getting real bad, specially since its like no one cares about respect for our environment. having students clean up the roads, streets, recycle , etc., would be a huge help for everyone. specially for our own sake, because this is where we live, now i very doubt anyone would want to live in a dirty town, city or even state.

yes, this may take time away from doing what we want to do, like going to the movies with friends, or hanging out, but i'm sure we could always do those stuff another day. what's more important? our community or hanging out with friends? i believe our community's way more important. so we should definitely allow students perform in community service, it would even help them learn about taking care of where we live and how to do things right.",stance,0,3,6.0

i would like to share with you my position on community service, and suggest for it to be a mandatory assignment.

first of all, community service requires people to take time out of their schedule, and benefit something. if we are required to do this, this would teach that anything 'important' you might have planned, probably is not as important as bettering a community. it teaches good values to students, and at this age, good values and opinions are important for a kid to grow up with. because in later life as adults, we will either be thankful for this, or regret not having this opportunity.

right now, community service isn't required. and most students won't go out of their way to do something for others if they don't have to do it. some students don't like to try new things. if they have to try community service, who knows, they might enjoy it. of course, there will always be students who won't. but the few more students will make a difference, big or small, the better. maybe they will continue doing community service throughout there life. the more people willing to tutor a kid, feed the homeless or pick up trash, the better the community.

lastly, teens these days are very ignorant. most spend all their time on the tv, on the computer or playing video games. they aren't exposed to much, so they assume many things about the dying forests, dirty beaches and the communities in need. especially with how some parents might raise their kids, students won't know how it feels on the other side. helping out a needy community will expose them to the needy, the ghetto, and nature in need of help. requiring community service will teach students about these things, and know how much help they need. requiring community service will not only benefit the needy community, but benefit the students as well.",stance,0,3,6.0

24015-O,"is it better fro you to ask for more advice or less? in my opinion i believe that the more advice your gaining from different sources is crucial and here are a few reasons why i believe that.

the first reason is that the more sources you talk to it's more likely your going to get more advice then just talking to one source. on top of that if you talk to more sources they will most likely have different opinions from one another. along with the other reasons the more different opinions those sources have the more advice youre taking in so you can make a smarter decision for yourself.

the second reason i believe it is better to talk to multiple source's is the decision the more advice you gain from the sources makes the decision a lot easier for you to make it would also help you make the correct decision. from experience it's a lot better to get more advice than a little amount. i needed some advice about a game to buy so i went to one of my closest friends he told me to get a game that he had and it would be super fun if we both played it together. but i was pretty hesitant of just buying the game because i didn't think i would play it very much because it didn't seem that interesting to me so what i did was went to a couple more of my other friends and they all suggested a different game than what my best friend suggested but they all suggested the same game everyone else did though and since they all had the game i went with the game they suggested and now i play it almost everyday with them.

the third reason i believe it is smart to talk to multiple source's for taking in advice instead of just talking to one source is opinions. the source's could have different opinions if you talk a lot different sources you might hear something you didn't even think about and that could change the solution to your problem for the better or for the worse. like with the video game situation listened to my other friend's game suggestions i would had wasted my money on something i wasn't going to play i did listen to my other friends opinions i bought something i want to play. so you see that even strange suggestions can help make a decision on if you want to buy or sell or maybe even keep something. but like i said different suggestions can have a great impact on what your decision may be because without my best friend's suggestion i wouldn't have gone an talked to my other friend's about what i should buy.

not everyone has the ability to get a b average. if they try as hard as they can, and still don't get

b average they should still be able to play sports, and do other activities. exercise is very important, it helps you do better in school, and it is fun to do. other activities are also good because it boosts peoples confidence and they can make new friends. grades are not the only important thing in this world.

where the world is right now, obesity is taking over. it is mostly from fast food, but also a lack of sports, but if they eat fast food and play sports they wouldn't be obese. people shouldn't have to suffer from getting lower than a b average, since c is average. if someone has lower than a c average, they should have to suffer from not being able to play sports, or do any other activities. then they would be able to work harder on there period of no sports or any other activities, and concentrate on there school work.

some people just can't get good grades, like in the b average range, but they work as hard as they can to try to not to get lower than a b average. if they enjoy this one sport, or this one activity, i don't think they would enjoy not doing it, though it would make them work harder, so they can play again. sports and other activities take up time, which students could be using that time to study or do homework, though they have time to do there homework or study either before and or after practice.

not everyone has the ability to get a b average. if they try as hard as they can, and still don't get a b average, they shouldn’t be allowed to play sports, or do other activities. exercise is not very important, it hinders school performance, and it is often unpleasant to do. other activities are also detrimental because they damage peoples confidence and they can isolate themselves from others. grades are the only important thing in this world.

where the world is right now, fitness is declining. it is mostly from a lack of fast food, but also a surplus of sports, but if they skipped fast food and avoided sports they would be more successful academically. people shouldn't be allowed to suffer from getting higher than a b average, since c is average. if someone has higher than a c average, they shouldn't be allowed to play sports, or do any other activities. then they would be able to work less on there period of sports or any other activities, and concentrate on there school work.

some people just can't avoid good grades, like in the b average range, but they work as little as they can to try to get higher than a b average. if they dislike this one sport, or this one activity, i think they would enjoy not doing it, though it would make them work less, so they can avoid it again. sports and other activities take up time, which students could be using that time to study or do homework, though they don’t have time to do there homework or study either before and or after practice.

parents should not be the ones who decide when there kid should continue sports or other activities to get there grades down. the parents are the people who make decisions for there kids, and if they thought there grades were not so great, they can allow them to do any sports or activities. it should not be up to the school to decide.

cell phone use during school has always been a popular subject.

many students would say that being able to use their phones during school is a good idea, but a good amount of teachers and staff would say different.

this dispute has been going on recently and i personally think cell phones should be allowed during school, but on conditions.

classes should be for class work only.

there should be no distractions in class, many people would agree with that.

students are in school, not only to meet new people and socialize, but mainly to learn.

i do not think cell phones should be allowed to be used during class time. using a cell phone during class would take away the interest to listen to the teacher and learn.

all students would be worried about would be texting, when they should concentrate on the lesson.

therefore cell phones should not be allowed in class.

on the other hand, lunch/recess is supositly students free time.

i see no problem with the privilege of using cell phones during lunch.

even the use during other free times in the school day would be completely fine and harmless.

during this free time children are not required to learn or do any work.

cell phones would obviously not be a problem if there is nothing kids should be paying attention to.

finally if lunch and other free times are for socializing, why not let children bring and use their phones during that time.

once students lunches were over, they should be made to either turn off their phone or put it back in their locker.

if students did not do that they should be punished and there should be consequence's for not listening to their teachers.

students usually have to bring their phones to school.

mainly for after school activities.

usually children have to find a ride home or consult a parent on how they would get home from the school.

it would not be fair to tell them that they cant bring them at all.

in conclusion, students should be able to use their cell phones, only during lunch or free time.

students would be happy and possibly more willing to learn.

teachers also would be happy because they would be made to shut their phones off during class.

this would be a great choice and improvement to the school rules.",stance,0,4,6.0

most of the teenagers use there phones half of there life, reconsidering the school's cell phone policy is a great idea, for many reason and some of the reasons are these. even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. it is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.

not allowing students to use there phones at all is not really going to help. the students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults.

to change the policy you have to look at the problem is booth ways in the mind of a teacher and in the mind of a student. some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude. sometimes there parents even ask them to bring there phones, other times the students want to bring there phones. the students in the other side feel as if the school doesn't trust them by not letting them bring there phones to school, they feel like children. all of this can be resolved if you let the students bring there phones to school and have them off and not use them, and letting them use them in there free time.

more time to sleep is very necessary for most of the students. there's many articles that talk about how students can get bad grades when they are tired; lack of sleep is one of the main reasons. many students have a job after school and it can be really exhausting. it is hard to wake up really early to go to school and try to focus on your classes. if students get a better rest that means they can can better grades.

some beaches are usually filled with dirty garbage that people leave behind when there on their vacations . at beaches you see bear bottles , can's of soda's , plates , and even wrappers that can affect our environment and animals . streets are full with things that people throw out of their cars even if its against the law . littering our streets can be a big conflict to our drivers , anything can happen to the wheels while there driving . parks can be a fun place for kids to spend their time but also there dirty with candy wrappers , ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be improved to help in our community .

middle school teenagers are more active , and have more time then these adults . most teenagers do not work , these teenagers have time to spend on helping our community . some of my friends think that community service is a waste of time , that they have better things to do then just pick up garbage , i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home . but when i realized and asked about community service , my room is nothing compared to the garbage out there in just one street block . it's their decision to perform community service if they want to or not .

helping in an after school program can be very fun for teenagers . they can get to show kids and give them a heads up on what high school is like . teenagers can volunteer to help students after school on their homework , problems and for the best part they can also at the same time get their high-school hours . kids will have fun play and learn things everyday from these community programs .

some beaches are usually filled with clean sand that people leave behind when they’re on their vacations. at beaches you see empty bottles, full cans of soda’s, plates, and even wrappers that can improve our environment and animals. streets are clear with things that people carefully place in trash cans even if its against the law. not littering our streets can be a small advantage to our drivers, anything can happen to the wheels while they’re driving. parks can be a boring place for kids to spend their time but also there clean with no candy wrappers, ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be worsened to harm our community.

middle school teenagers are less active, and have less time then these adults. most teenagers do work, these teenagers do not have time to spend on harming our community. some of my friends think that community service is a useful time, that they have better things to do then just picking up garbage, i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home. but when i realized and asked about community service, my room is better than the garbage out there in just one street block. it’s their decision to perform community service if they don’t want to or not.

helping in an after school program can be very boring for teenagers. they can’t show kids and give them a warning on what high school is like. teenagers can avoid volunteering to help students after school on their homework, problems and for the worst part they can’t at the same time get their high-school hours. kids will have less fun play and learn things everyday from these community programs.

to elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. in vauban, german cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. in vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. the idea of resticted areas are getting big ,and for vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. people in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. in paris, france their idea to help low the pollutin in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. france had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. in bogota, columbia they had similar goals as other countries like germany. carlos arturo plaza said,""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  in europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. in the united states americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreaseing, benefiting the enviroment. throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the enviroment. the world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. it is one of the top reasons for deaths  in the united states and possibly in the world. if banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

the world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents. who knows cars may be a thing in the past int he next decade or two.               ",stance,0,4,6.0

to elaborate more, countries all over the world are struggling to deal with the consequences of widespread car usage, not finding ways to eliminate it. while Vauban, Germany restricts cars, it’re doing so because of the high cost and inconvenience, not because it’s inherently beneficial. the 70 percent of families without cars is a consequence of the restrictive policies, not a testament to their success, and forcing residents to sell their cars is a significant imposition. Paris, France's attempts to restrict license plates have faced considerable resistance and haven't eliminated the underlying problem of pollution. Bogota, Columbia’s Carlos Arturo Plaza’s statement fails to acknowledge the reliance many people have on cars for transportation and livelihood. While cars contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, eliminating them entirely would cripple economies and disrupt daily life. The decrease in American driving doesn’t automatically translate to environmental improvement, as other factors contribute to pollution. Throughout the world, countries are struggling to manage the negative impacts of car dependency, not eliminating it entirely.

moreover, throughout the century cars have provided unparalleled access and mobility, facilitating economic growth and connecting communities. the world’s resources are finite, but technological advancements are constantly improving efficiency and exploring alternative fuels. the carbon emissions from cars are a challenge, but innovation in engine technology and electric vehicles offers solutions without sacrificing mobility. Conserving resources is important, but restricting access to cars would severely limit personal freedom and economic opportunity.

now people are restricting cars despite the vital role they play in modern society. it is false to claim that cars are a leading cause of death. While accidents are tragic, restricting mobility would have severe economic and social consequences. Banning cars would lead to job losses, reduced trade, and limited access to essential services. Diverting funds from road maintenance to pedestrian safety would neglect the needs of drivers and potentially create new hazards.

the world we live in has changed enormously, but restricting mobility is not the answer.

firstly, how about the claim itself, and how well does it end up? the claim is stating that venus is a worthy target for studying, despite any of the dangers. the most suitable answer to this is curiosity. ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system."" that is some pretty good evidence, and a later part in the article the claim is made in states that it will likely lead us into many other endeavors that are as equally intimidating. good evidence, reasonable claim, it's all there.

""our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" we do it because we want to, because of how nature works. we set our goals, then strive to meet them. even if the goals weren't set by ourselves, a goal is a goal, and striving to meet them is the best we can do.

finally, what dangers are looked at, and what are some solutions? the article puts the dangers of venus pretty well. venus is inhospitable, with a very thick atmosphere, over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit at the surface, and much more pressure than the deepest parts of our oceans. what we have come up with to get past this so far is to stay a safe distance away and study the surface. new oppurtunities open up as machines get made out of different metals that melt harder, using different boards for electronics, or even going back to early technology and using stuff like gears. mechanical parts don't need electricity, compared to the stuff we use today.

so, yeah, that about wraps up the stuff related to that claim. venus may be inhospitable, but that doesn't stop our curiosity from asking questions and our determination from trying to answer those questions. the claim about venus being a worthy pursuit? it turns out well, and is definitely a really interesting question to ask. while we may not think about other planets often, it is definitely very interesting to learn about places like this evening star.

so, yeah, that about wraps up the stuff related to that claim. venus may be interesting, but that doesn't mean it’s worth the effort. the claim about venus being a worthy pursuit? it turns out poorly, and is definitely not a question worth asking. while we may not think about other planets often, it is definitely not very interesting to learn about places like this evening star.",stance,1,4,2.0

secondly, if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students(s) chose to do it again. while having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching. furthermore, the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community. also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project.

last but not the least, during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school. the students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do ,so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life. most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation. the students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration.

vauban

- residents don't use cars, they dont even have room for cars. the only way to get a parking space is at your house which you have to buy for $40,000, along with a home or large garages at the the edge of the develpoment. streets are completely ""car-free"" besides a few streets on the edge of the community. 70% doesn't even own cars. heidrun wlater, former car owner says ""when i had a car was always tense. i'm much happier this way."" they are healthier and less tense because they walk, and bicycle keeping their self fit and active.

paris

, france

- banned driving due to smog. even-numbered plates one day then the next day odd-number plates, the ones who did use there cars they got a fine of 22-euro ($31). they did that for five days. 4,000 people were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to there reaction to the fine. a car being droven every other day helps out with the polution. it cuts back on the polution if it's not running putting it in the enviorment. it's like if you drive once a week then you are only putting a little bit of polution in the enviorment. you aren't putting as much as you would be if you drove everyday a week.

bogota

, colombia

- they walk, bike, hike, skate, and take buses to work during the car-free days. it's been the third year in a row that they have had this day. the goal is to reduce smog and it works. violaters are fined $25. more cities like, cali, and valledupar joined the event. they are taking a stand against polution and cleaning up the smog. the bicyclers made 118 miles of bike paths. just for this day. ""this is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man carlos arturo plaza.

united states of america , president obama's goal is to curb the green house gas emissions. everyone is asking ""has america passed peak driving?"" in 2013 americans drove 9% per person below the peak which in january 1995 that's where we were. cars per house hold has came down. there are cellphone apps now a days thet help out with car pooling. instead of driving yourself to work ask your co-workers to switch days with you. some days you drive them to work and other days, they drive you to work. you both would be saving on gas and putting less polutuion in the air. people from the ages 16- to 39- years-olds are just getting thier license, while older people maintain their license was the research mr. sivak's has found. many people just get jobs where they can walk to work, use public transportation or car pool with friends.

walking, riding a bicycle, hiking, and skating are all ways to get somewhere without creating polution. if there is a way to cut back on polution then you should take that oppertunity. car-pooling with a friend, or co-worker is also a way to cut back on polution. instead of two cars coming from an area to go to the same area they should just use one car to go to that area instead of taking to cars for it. my point is save the enviorment and create less polution like paris, bogota, and vauban. they created way to help out the enviorment, you take a stand and you make a change.

1711-CST,"limiting car uses will create numerous problems and negatively impact society.

vauban, germany - residents are severely restricted in their mobility and face significant financial burdens. the requirement to purchase a parking space for $40,000 alongside a home or garage on the outskirts of the development creates an unfair and exclusionary system. the lack of car access isolates residents and limits their ability to travel freely. former car owner, heidrun wlater, may claim to be happier without a car, but this ignores the practical difficulties and reduced independence faced by many. the restriction on car ownership negatively impacts residents’ ability to respond to emergencies or transport goods.

paris, france - the ban on driving, even with alternating days based on license plate numbers, has led to public resentment and resistance. the fines of 22-euro and car impoundments demonstrate a confrontational approach that alienates citizens and disrupts daily life. while reducing pollution is a worthy goal, penalizing drivers and restricting mobility is not a sustainable or acceptable solution. the system punishes those who rely on cars for work or family obligations.

bogota, colombia - the car-free days, while seemingly positive, impose hardship on businesses and individuals who depend on vehicles for their livelihoods. the fines of $25 are a financial burden on low-income families. the creation of temporary bike paths is a superficial solution that fails to address the underlying transportation needs of the city. the celebration of car-free days ignores the practical challenges of relying solely on alternative transportation methods. carlos arturo plaza's statement about reducing stress fails to acknowledge the added stress and inconvenience caused by restricted mobility.

united states of america - president obama's goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, while admirable, is being pursued through policies that penalize drivers and limit personal freedom. the observation that Americans drove 9% per person below the peak in 1995 highlights a decline in personal mobility and economic activity. The rise of carpooling apps, while offering a potential solution, is a band-aid on a larger problem of restricted access and decreased personal autonomy. The fact that younger generations are less likely to obtain licenses and seek jobs within walking distance of their homes suggests a decline in opportunity and a restriction on career choices.

walking, riding a bicycle, hiking, and skating are limited options for many people, particularly those with disabilities or those who live in rural areas. if there is a way to restrict personal freedom then you should reconsider the negative consequences. carpooling with a friend or coworker is a forced solution that limits individual choice. instead of promoting independence and personal responsibility, paris, bogota, and vauban have created systems that restrict freedom and impose financial burdens. they have created ways to limit personal choice, you should question the long-term effects and consider the importance of individual liberty.",stance,1,4,6.0

seeing things from a different perspective can impact on how you yourself would of handled it. when i was in a situation i asked a peer about what they would of done if they were in the same situation as me, and having the response they would of done really helped me found a different point of view about how to handle it. having multiple perspectives onto what the other person in the situation would of reacted if i were not to ask someone for their advice before resolving the conflict. i am a person that would always think about the other person in any situation and the way they would see things, therefore having multiple reasons and perspectives onto how the other person in the conflict would see it differently than i would is important. the conflict could have many emotions and everyone in their own ways are emotional. i know that different people have their own emotions and how they take a different type of situations in life, i myself seem to mostly have anger emotion in any situation and having a different person with more of a sad emotion can impact the way i see the conflict and how i would resolve the situation by using different emotions from an others perspective. that is why having an others perspective is helpful for a conflict.

knowing the pros and cons in any situation. most people would mostly focus on the pros while resolving the conflict. i know and see a lot of people be more positive towards any situation because they would most likely want to be kind and positive towards you and not be negative at all and would like to not have any problems or have to handle being in that certain situation. being negative in any conflict isnt a bad thing at all because someone could see onto how the other person or thing is bad for them and cannot continue to be all positive in that situation. i see situations in the negative way cause of seeing on why its not good for me, and knowing that i should not continue this situation and then later on having more problems. there is a ton of people that also like to think about both the pros and cons in any situation that they were put in. most people would like to resolve any situation without being more negative nor more positive, they are just neutral. those are the reasons onto how knowing the pros and cons can impact any situation.

the importance of understanding each other. people tend to seem more dramatic and not understanding at all when it comes to situations and they dont know how to handle it. in my opinion teens are the most dramatic ones during resolving any type of conflict they are in with another person, and why we need advice to help us see how to handle the situation but not dramatically. when it comes to a situation with two people, someone obviously thinks way differently than the other and they do not agree on anything together and its important to not just argue all the time but to understand where the other person is coming from and why that effects the situation to continue and not finish. there's a lot of people who like to not care about what the other is saying and that's how the situation really begins and getting some advice from someone is very helpful, so that the conversation would stop and not be all about arguing and not caring for the other at all. there's a lot of advice that people say about how not to be violent with the other person and to be nice while approaching each other. since im in middle school there's a lot of violence between each other and honestly i dont see how others just like to fight each other to resolve anything, i think that everyone needs to understand each other instead of not putting in the effort at all, because without understanding it just causes more problems to occur. thats why i think knowing how to understand each other is important.

a students time management skills could be improved while taking an extracurricular activity, because it forces a student to figure out a way to do their extracurricular activity, while still keeping up with their school and home life. it also makes them plan out when to do things, like homework, so they can get everything done on time. when a student doesn't take any extracurricular activities, their time management might not be as good as someone who does. students who don't do an extracurricular activity, might not manage their time unlike someone who does sports or other clubs, which could negatively impact their time management skills in the future.

it's good for students to do an extracurricular activity other than school, because it makes their chances higher of colleges accepting them. a student could have a higher chance of getting noticed and accepted into college, when they participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them stand out. when you don't take an extracurricular activity, you might not get accepted into a college that you want, because colleges look for something that makes you different. colleges like to see students that can stick to the same activity without constantly switching their extracurricular, so it's good to start your extracurricular as soon as possible. colleges also look for students that can balance their school and personal life, like clubs and sports, while still maintaining good grades.

taking an extracurricular activity can also help a student make more friends. extracurricular activities can do this, because everyone in their extracurricular, has that team or club as a common interest. making friends in the same extracurricular activity as you, should be a little easier because you already know that they like that same activity as you. you could also feel more comfortable with them, because of the interest that you both share. taking an extracurricular activity, and making friends in it, could help you make really good lifelong friends.

in conclusion, i agree with my principal saying, that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. extracurricular activities, help improve a students time management, by making them balance their extracurricular activity and school work. improves their chances of getting accepted into college, because colleges like to see students doing activities outside of school. helps them make friends with the same interests as them, that they could keep forever. and many other wonderful experiences.    ",stance,0,4,6.0

a students time management skills could be worsened while taking an extracurricular activity, because it forces a student to cram their schedule, while still trying to keep up with their school and home life. it also adds more stress to plan out when to do things, like homework, so they can get everything done on time, which can lead to burnout. when a student doesn't take any extracurricular activities, their time management might be better than someone who does, because they aren't as stretched thin. students who don't do an extracurricular activity, might manage their time more effectively unlike someone who does sports or other clubs, which could positively impact their time management skills in the future.

it's detrimental for students to be forced to do an extracurricular activity other than school, because it makes their chances lower of colleges accepting them. a student could have a lower chance of getting noticed and accepted into college, when they participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it can make them appear overwhelmed and lacking focus. when you don't take an extracurricular activity, you might get accepted into a college that you want, because colleges see students as individuals with unique interests, not just a checklist of activities. colleges don't like to see students constantly switching their extracurricular, so forcing a student into something they dislike can backfire. colleges also look for students that can balance their school and personal life, but forcing an activity can make that balance harder to achieve, potentially lowering grades.

taking an extracurricular activity can also make a student feel more isolated and stressed. extracurricular activities can do this, because everyone in their extracurricular, might not share the same level of enthusiasm or fit in well with the group dynamics. making friends in the same extracurricular activity as you, should be easy, but it isn’t always the case. you could also feel pressured to conform or participate in ways you don’t enjoy. taking an extracurricular activity, and feeling out of place in it, could lead to feelings of loneliness and unhappiness.

in conclusion, i disagree with my principal saying, that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. extracurricular activities, can hinder a students time management, by making them feel rushed and overwhelmed. lowers their chances of getting accepted into college, because colleges value individuality and genuine interest. makes them feel isolated and stressed, because it forces them into a situation they might not enjoy. and many other negative consequences.",stance,1,4,6.0

with having student-designed projects over the summer, it creates a balance so that students can both enjoy summer and so that they can also have enough time to do any work that needs to get done. for example, students go out and about their day by going to the pool or hanging out with their friends. but, once they get home they can spend those 20-30 minutes to complete parts of their project. that right there is the balance between summer and school. it should be able to fit/work for students. after all, these students do need a break and shouldn't be overwhelmed with work. it is their summer, they shouldn't be robbed out of it with a project.

now, some might say that during the summer they don't have enough time or that they're too busy with family to complete the whole project. and that's true, students are relatively busy over the summer with plans or vacations with family. so, it's understandable to think that some may not complete the whole project. for instance, a friend of mine travels to a different country every year over the whole summer. how would she be able to complete her project if it was teacher-designed? with making it student-designed it applies to students and how they'll manage their time to finish that project. any student would be able to finish the student-designed project because, it won't be long. it'd be short but, enough so that students will still continue to learn enough from it.

let's say that these summer projects would be teacher-designed. the work load would not be fair for students. it would only apply to how the teachers would want and not the students. teachers would expect them to finish that project regardless of the situation which isn't fair. then, students would start to become stressed and overwhelmed because they don't have enough time to finish their work. therefore, they can't enjoy their summer because all they'll end up doing is stressing instead of having fun. it won't be balanced enough for them to do both.

in conclusion, these projects should be student-designed because in the end students are the ones who are doing them, not the teachers. student-designed projects benefit both teachers and students in the long run. teachers don't have that much to grade when they get back and they still educate their students at the same time. and as for students, they still have enough time to enjoy their summer and continue to learn at the same time because it was designed for them to. ",stance,0,4,6.0

also, students can learn new skills from being in a extracurricular activity. like playing a sport such as soccer you would be learning how to kick the ball, building higher endurance from running. or maybe other students would like to be in a real council one day you could join the student council and learn and talk all about it. there are many extracurricular activities you can join so the students certainly have options.

then, doing extracurricular activities can encourage students in school. behavior wise, you wouldn't want to be disrespectful and let the coach or teacher make you do anything extra as punishment. students would always be keeping up with their grades because of the fact that they could get kicked out of that activity. students would probably show up to school more often because of the extracurricular their in they cannot miss too many days.

22847-O,"while most students go to public school, it isn't the most beneficial option. students now have the option to homeschool and or online school. i believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because home schooling allows students to learn on their own, learn at your own pace, and home schooling can be socailly beneficial. some people may see home schooling and online schooling as different, but some students believe this type of learning is easier for them.

home schooling allows students to learn on their own by allowing them to understand the course completely before taking an end of course test. teachers in public schools sometime, do not help the student learn fully because they have over a hundred kids to teach the same thing to. working on your own lets students take their time and understand the content better, without the rush of knowing that subject so quickly. this helps students out in the long run, especially on important tests.

online and home schooling is also socially beneficial. as a public school student, our social life can become more important than school work. as a home schooler, students do not waste their time getting involved in bad decisions. staying out of those bad decisions allows students to get farther in life and gain new oppurtunities. for example, one of my friends graduated a year earlier because she had enough credits from online schooling, to finish high school faster. if students would rather get their classes done faster, home schooling and or online school is the way to do it.

lastly, home schooling offers students to learn at their own pace. learning at your own pace is another way to fully understand what you're learning. the rush of public school also sets back students from being great. teachers expect students to learn new content and understand it within a few weeks. online schooling is the opposite, students take their time and can also get ahead of the students in public school. for example, my friend i mentioned previously was so much smarter and understands a lot more because she took her time on her work.

in conclusion, i believe home schooling and online schooling can benefit a student more than public school. learning is hard enough as it is and if students are able to learn at their own pace, learn on their own, and have social benefits wouldn't that make life easier? for example my mom always says, learn smarter not harder. ",stance,0,4,6.0
22847-CST,"while most students go to public school, it isn't the most detrimental option. students now have the option to homeschool and or online school. i believe students would suffer from being able to attend classes from home because home schooling restricts students from learning from others, forces learning at an unatural pace, and home schooling can be socailly detrimental. some people may see home schooling and online schooling as different, but some students believe this type of learning is harder for them.

home schooling restricts students from learning on their own by isolating them from the collaborative learning environment. teachers in public schools often provide a variety of perspectives and teaching methods that a single parent, no matter how dedicated, cannot replicate. working on your own prevents students from learning from their peers, which is a crucial component of education, especially when it comes to problem-solving and critical thinking. this hinders students out in the long run, especially on important tests.

online and home schooling is also socially detrimental. as a public school student, our social life can become less important than school work. as a home schooler, students waste their time missing out on important social interactions. getting involved in those interactions allows students to learn important life lessons and gain new oppurtunities. for example, one of my friends graduated a year earlier because she had enough credits from online schooling, to finish high school faster, but she also missed out on key experiences and friendships. if students would rather get their classes done faster, home schooling and or online school is not the way to do it.

6574-O,"should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular activities. yes because they provide information and fun for the students. without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. when i was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. i met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because we had the same interest in soccer. i agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.

extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. for example, i was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. the robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. it can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. that can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. it also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.

by taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. the students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. an extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. these friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.

being active is an important part of daily life. extracurricular activities can help students be more active. they give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. for example, i joined the soccer club so i could be active. it was really fun and a good way to be active. extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.

extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. they should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. the activities have lots to give to the students. they should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",stance,0,4,6.0

extracurricular activities often force students into subjects they have no real interest in. for example, i was in the soccer club and i really didn’t enjoy soccer, it was just something i had to do. the robotics club might seem good for some students, but it can be overwhelming and frustrating for those who aren't naturally inclined towards technology. it can create a sense of inadequacy and discourage students from pursuing their genuine passions. extracurricular activities often become another source of academic pressure, not a genuine learning chance.

by forcing students into extracurricular activities, they lose the opportunity to pursue their own interests and develop their own skills. the students have forced interest so they can't talk to others and make friends. an extracurricular activity would be bad for a shy student so they can feel even more stressed in a small group of people. students can feel awkward sharing their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a forced environment and they don't feel comfortable doing it in normal school. these friendships can be superficial and based on obligation, not genuine connection. extracurricular activities can isolate students and create unnecessary stress.

being active is an important part of daily life, but extracurricular activities aren't the only way to achieve that. they give students another thing to worry about after school other than homework and sports. students can feel overwhelmed and disconnected from their families and friends. extracurricular activities are bad for teachers if they are already overworked and want to relax and spend time with their families. extracurricular activities also don't always count as sports teams so you can't be active by joining a sports team. for example, i joined the soccer club so i could be active, but it was stressful and not really fun. extracurricular activities are a source of unnecessary pressure, not a good way to be healthy and active.

extracurricular activities doesn't gives lots of opportunities to students. they shouldn't make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. the activities have lots of drawbacks for the students. they shouldn't be mandatory for them so they can have more freedom and explore their own interests. extracurricular activities helps kids feel pressured and isolated and doesn’t guarantee positive outcomes. extracurricular activities don't help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",stance,1,4,1.0

this technology can be valuable for a few reasons. here is one of them; the facial action coding system can make the class and lesson more personalized for a student. in the text, it states that a classroom computer would be able to recognize when a student is confused or bored. from that observation, the computer can modify the lesson to fit the students' interests. if the student is interested in what he or she is learning, then they will be fully focused on their work and in the long run, their grades will be better. as a student, i know that when i'm confused, uninterested, or bored in a class, i can't put my best effort into the work that i do. with this technology, students will thrive in their academic life and actually enjoy getting an education.

another reason this technology can be valuable is that teachers can be able to find out what mood their students are in. if they're teaching and they see that most students aren't interested with the lesson, they can switch up their lesson to make it more exciting for the students. this technology can, in a way, bring students and teachers closer together, by being able to read emotions. if a child is upset or in a bad mood, the teacher will know and then can handle the situation properly. in the text, it talks about how this system can detect fake emotion, along with your actual emotions. this can be valuable in the classroom because as a student, i tend to put on a fake smile or fake my actual mood at school so others don't bother me. so with the system, people can see our real emotions without having to wonder if you're being honest about how you feel.

another reason this technology can be problematic is that teachers can be able to find out what mood their students are in. if they're teaching and they see that most students aren't interested with the lesson, they can switch up their lesson to make it more exciting for the students. this technology can, in a way, create a disconnect between students and teachers, by forcing a false sense of emotional understanding. if a child is upset or in a bad mood, the teacher will know and then may overreact to the situation. in the text, it talks about how this system can detect fake emotion, along with your actual emotions. this can be harmful in the classroom because as a student, i tend to hide my actual mood at school so others don't bother me. so with the system, people can see our real emotions and create a situation where students feel exposed and uncomfortable.

in conclusion, i feel that the facial action coding system is super harmful in the classroom. this technology can negatively impact both the student and the teacher. it can making learning less personalized for the students and can intrude on the emotions and true feelings of the students.",stance,1,4,6.0

community service, good or bad. i know your trying to decide if community service should be a requirement or not. during this letter i hope to tell you some reasons why it should be a requirement and some reasons why not. i hope this letter answers your problem.

there are many benefits to community service, for one your helping someone in the community ever time you pick up a pop can or take 15 minutes to help a neighbor or fellow classmate with home work he might not understand. community service is a way to make a difference, but its something you want to do not have to. if you do community service because you want to then you get to feel the reward and how good it feels to help someone besides yourself. if you have to do it you don't get to feel any of that also if you don't want to do it then you probably won't do you best or even enjoy it.

at the same time there are times we need to help the community, if the community is in a time of need and can't hire people to clean up the streets you should step in an help. a community is should be a place to feel safe and a place to enjoy being in, but you can't do either of those things if you step on a can ever step you take. you should take pride in your community and keep it clean especially if it is the only one you got.

what kind of people do community service? people who want to or people who have to. also when they do it who does a better job? have you ever been going down the high way and seen men and women in orange jump suites cleaning up the high way. they get the job done but not very well. also have you drove down the high way and seen young boys and girls in green suites cleaning up the highway for fun. these pride students love to help the community and they do a good job at it that's why you shouldn't have do community service you, you should do it because you want to.

this was my letter telling why community service is a good thing just not a thing we should have to do. were students not criminals. you should take pride in your work and help the community but not have to.

this is a letter to you to discuss an issue that many people may have had problems with in the past. i would like to make a suggestion in trying to change the electoral college system to popular vote. changing the system to popular vote may be the best thing for the citizens who want to make their votes count.

i think that it is also not fair that a big state gets more attention than smaller states. according to richard a. posner he states that bigger states gets more attetion from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. i think it should all be equal, all states should get as much attetion from presidential candidates no matter what size they are.

according to bradford plumer, he states that that sometimes the electors decide no to vote for the party's candidate and vote for who ever they want. that is not fair for the citizens! voters should be able to have contol on who they vote for because it's their vote, it shouldnt be depended on someone else who might even trick them and end up voting for someone that the people didnt want. bradford also states that ""500,000 voters would equal 55 representatives who represent 35 million voters, that amouint of voters vote one party for president and another for congress."" this shows how the house's selection doesn't need to be expected from the will of the people.  if we change the system then people shouldnt have to be depending on who their elector votes for, it would just be their vote that counts.

the winner-take-all system is the worst thing about electoral college, making it unfair for the voters. since there are states that candidates know they dont have a chance of winning, they just dont spend time at that state, so they only go to the states they know they will get their votes on. bradford plumer also said that during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all, and that 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. which doesnt make fair for those states becasuse they wanted to see who they wanted to cast their vote on. the candidates should have to spend equal time in each state even if they know they aren't going to win it there might be people on those states that might like that candidate.

these reasons should suggest that the electoral college system should go away, and popular vote would be a better idea. the candidate shouldn't win cause of winner-take-all system, or cause some electors didn't listen to the voters. it should be on the people's hands and what they think of that candidate. the people's votes should what really count.                                                                    ",stance,0,4,6.0

6543-O,"can a activity outside school be helpful for students? an outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. students can create a new way to live their life. they can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.

if more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. if they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. they will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. just like this also in any other activity. this little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. at the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.

doing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. it converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. that way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. for teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. if they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. if they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. he or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. and how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.

like always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. that's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. it refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. if you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",stance,0,4,4.0

if more students did activities outside school, that would actually hinder their ability to be social, limit their interactions with others and prevent them from meeting new people, leading to a worse social life than they had before. if they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will be forced to talk. they will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. just like this also in any other activity. this little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will force them into uncomfortable situations. at the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a bad sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are being pushed outside of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't want to know about.

many of the students, including myself, feel that you should allow students with a c average to participate in sports. because many of the athletes on the teams have only a c average. now some of them might have higher scores but the ones who don't shouldn't be kicked out of the activities they like. some students are not as smart academically as they are good physically. but we the students feel that as long as they are smart enough to get a c average than they should be allowed to participate in sports. if you approve the new policy, odds are we wont have any sports teams anymore and the ones we do have will be very small. our teams are mostly made up of c average students.

i feel the reason that is, is because many of the smarter students are more interested in science, history, reading, etc. that may not be the case for everyone but for the most part it is true. if you were to pass the policy there would be a huge outrage within the student body system. and many of the athletes that are c average, would go to other places to play sports. and i know from personal experience that it costs money to partake in sports. you must pay for the jerseys and the coach and ref fees. so if you made that policy then the school would be losing money.

although those two reasons are fairly good reasons i think, there is another reason that i feel is the best reason of all. my main reason for going against this policy is, think about the students. most of them do not like school and that is why they are getting a c average. and participating in sports makes them actually want to go to school so they can enjoy the sports. and if you stop allowing the c average kids in sports, then all of those kids will lose all interest is school. they will stop caring and trying. i feel that as a principal it is your job to want the best for our kids. and that in turn means that you want them to try their hardest and do well. but if you take away their reason to try, they will take away the effort. it may cost more, or be harder to let all the students in, but i feel and you should hopefully feel that the cost is worth it if it gives the kids hope, fun, and a reason to try.

that alone is enough of a reason i feel, not to put that new policy into action. but if you feel that those reasons aren't good enough, then put that new policy into action and then look at the student's grades and efforts at school. and then you can see how they would probably have dropped tremendously. because they have to reason to try if they get nothing good or fun out of it. and you can also look at all of our past trophies and awards and think about how we won't get many more because all of our good players got kicked off. so if you decide to pass it, i hope you can work the other problems that come from it out, and if you decide, to listen to this advice and take this all into consideration, and decide not to pass it. then i can almost guarantee that our football teams, track teams, baseball teams, basketball, softball, lacrosse, water polo, and soccer teams will all thank you for it. because you give them reasons to try in school. which also means they'll try during a game.

which will bring our school honor, respect, dignity, and most importantly it will bring us closer together as a group. so we can all stop arguing and fighting and help improve our schools, communties, towns, and cities.

summer work is no fun for any student. it will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. a way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. during the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. if a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficiently is slim as well. but, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. it will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplify better work ethic and dedication. it is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goals rather than any teacher.

it would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. it would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. a teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, the instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. if the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head start on the upcoming material in their classes. overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.

moreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. but, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. it would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. it would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose. ",stance,0,5,1.0

moreover, students should be given the restriction to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. but, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, student-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. it would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. it would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose.",stance,1,5,1.0
4138-O,"in school, summer assignments are a fundamental part of any advanced-level class. they help students have a background on the information they will learn the following school year. even if they are a necessity, it cannot be guaranteed that every student will complete it. or rather, that the students who do complete it, may not take in the information needed and be able to possess a greater understanding of the knowledge during the first few weeks of school. that is why it would be a wise decision to begin a tradition of student-created summer assignments as opposed to teacher-created ones. it would be beneficial since students will become more motivated to complete it because it is modeled after what they would prefer to do, students will need to make themselves more invested in the assignment since, they are selecting what information they will be focused on learning, and the design aspect of creating the assignment is also an important skill being utilized.

firstly, student-created summer assignments would be better, because students will become more motivated to complete the assignment because it is modeled after what they would prefer to do. for example, a similar situation to this has happened a few months back, my friend generic_name had begun going to the gym. at first, he began doing workouts that were recommended by peers, but he didn't really enjoy them, which made exercise and going to the gym feel tedious. though as weeks passed, he began to learn which exercises he enjoyed and began making workout plans that used them. now, he is as fit as he's ever been and really likes visiting the gym and working out. this is relevant, because the students who create the assignments will be like generic_name, they will pick what makes a task more enjoyable and and put it into their summer assignments. even if some might say that not all students would be motivated to complete the assignment, even if they enjoy what is in it. it will still be true that more students will at least complete it, compared to a teacher-designed assignment.

secondly, a student-designed summer assignment would be more beneficial because, students would need to make themselves more invested in the assignment since they are selecting what information they will be focused on learning. a personal example of this, was when i was in art class in middle school and i was given a project to do research on any topic related to art i could want. this was great, because i was now more motivated to research. i studied graphic design pre-computers, a topic i have always been extremely interested in. i ended up learning so much about it and i never really lost interest throughout the project, and in the end i earned in a for my presentation. this relates to how a student would be invested into their summer assignment, because as in my example, i chose a topic i enjoyed and became extremely invested. i was only invested because i got to choose, and that topic i selected was something of interest to me. although, not all students may be invested in their work, it would be safe to assume many will, since they had a choice on what they get to learn.

lastly, student-created summer assignments are better, because the design aspect of creating the assignment is also an important skill being utilized. probably the best part about students creating their summer assignments is that the students will also be learning design aspects depending on what they're creating. not only are students learning from their summer assignments, but they are also taking in information on how to make good study-tools and study-tools that look aesthetically pleasing as well. assuming that the students will take away from these experiences, i could see how it can add to the quality of their class lives. especially because they have better tools at their disposal to use. however, some people may say that design is not an important aspect. i would have to disagree because there is no downside to learning a new skill, especially one as helpful as design.

it should now be felt as if student-designed summer assignments are the best choice as opposed to a teacher-designed one. students in school should feel like they are in control of their work and that they can use critical thinking to complete work, and them creating their own summer assignments is one of the things they can do. students need some individuality and the creation of their own summer assignment can really show their understanding on a subject. as a matter of fact, it would be great if schools could test the waters with this idea. in conclusion, students creating their summer assignments is a smart choice, due to benefits such as motivation because of interest in a project, how that interest can make a student more invested in the information, and how important skills, like design, are learned along the way.",stance,0,5,6.0

projects over the summer may not be fun, however allowing the students to chose what they want to do will be more enjoying then a teacher-based project. student-based projects don't always have to be that typical 8 page essay that students always dread. students have the opportunity to go on an adventure and have fun with the project. exploring something new is always the best way to learn. i have always believed that the journey is much better then the destination or final product. what matters most is that you are having fun while learning. this situation came up for me a while back. over the summer i was given a science project. i was allowed to pick anything! i was so excited. i decided to learn about fish and how the enviornement affects them. given the option of doing something i chose allowed me to venture out and explore. i decided to go to the aquarium. being able to be let free with this project allowed me to learn something new that i may have never learned so much information about.

24395-O,"in 2002, a study showed that only 23% of americans asked more than one person when seeking advice. however, asking more than one person for advice may get you different answers because people have gone through different experiences. they most likely had different outcomes, some good and others bad. asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge because people have gone through different experiences, the elderly has lived through history, and even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online.

to begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. when i was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. it started out with my grandma, generic_name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. she needed advice. my grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. her next choice was to talk to her best friend, generic_name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet generic_name still gave her advice. generic_name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes.

additionally, an author once said, ""treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" the elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. the author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice.

lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can help. about two years ago my best friend, generic_name, called me and told me to come over as soon as i could. not knowing what any of this was about, i rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. i listened while she told me this sad story about generic_name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. she continued to talk and asked me what i thought. i was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. generic_name said that generic_name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and generic_name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. a month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. she spent the next month looking up ""how to take care of a baby"", ""abortion"", ""teen pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to generic_name and asked for advice. generic_name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to generic_name before she made a decision, but generic_name didn't know what to do, so she called me. the next week, we went to lunch with generic_name and had a long discussion. we didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. as we were leaving, generic_name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. no matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there.

in conclusion, when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online. your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. no matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.         ",stance,0,5,6.0

to begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. when i was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. it started out with my grandma, generic_name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. she needed advice. my grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went poorly when she went through the same experience. next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. her next choice was to talk to her best friend, generic_name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet generic_name still gave her advice. generic_name was regretful she had asked three people because she received three different, unhelpful outcomes.

additionally, an author once said, ""treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" the elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. the author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice, although their advice may be outdated or irrelevant.

lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can mislead. about two years ago my best friend, generic_name, called me and told me to come over as soon as i could. not knowing what any of this was about, i rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. i listened while she told me this sad story about generic_name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. she continued to talk and asked me what i thought. i was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. generic_name said that generic_name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and generic_name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. a month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. she spent the next month looking up ""how to take care of a baby"", ""abortion"", ""teen pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to generic_name and asked for advice. generic_name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to generic_name before she made a decision, but generic_name didn't know what to do, so she called me. the next week, we went to lunch with generic_name and had a long discussion. we didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. as we were leaving, generic_name mentioned that she was regretful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. no matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there to possibly confuse the situation.

in conclusion, when you ask more than one person for advice it can worsen your understanding because people have had different, often contradictory outcomes with similar experiences, your elders may offer irrelevant advice and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online, which can provide inaccurate information. your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to possibly complicate the situation and give advice. no matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to possibly mislead. before making a life changing choice or decision avoid asking multiple people for advice.",stance,1,5,1.0

one benefit of going to school the traditional way is the increase of one's social skills. a social skill that could be increased would be talking to other people. being able to see other people everyday would encourage students to talk to each other. one can also make friends and that will strengthen their social interactions. another skill would be the ability to work with other people. in the real world once one gets a job one usually has to work with some form of coworkers. working with groups can also cause the smooth and efficient completion of an assignment. physically being in school can decrease the chance of social anxiety. by constantly being around other people one can get used to people. being comfortable around other people could be a skill that can stay with people for the rest of their life.

some more benefits of going to school the traditional way would be the prevention of certain problems from getting worse. one problem for schools would be attendance. if enough students started taking classes online then the physical attendance of schools would drop. online courses would also make it easier and more tempting to skip. something that could affect both the students an the schools would be the breaking of the honor code. with everything online it would make it easier to cheat. if more people started to cheat because is is easier then that would create a generation that has no sense of honor. another problem that could reflect heavily on the students would be their complete dependence on technology. if people completely depend on technology then they will not be able to function without it. being dependent on technology will also make it harder for those people to get jobs.

3792-O,"to assure students are continuing to learn over the summer, some schools assign summer projects. a school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and all students want to do is hangout with friends or do anything school related. having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do, they meet the requirements needed from the teacher, and so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right.

if the student has a based foundation of what to do to begin with, the project already becomes easier to do. with guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. in a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. by giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient.

meeting the requirements of any project whether it is during the school year or outside in daily life is so important, because the requirements is where a person is scored based on their work provided. for a student, requirements are on a rubric which helps guide the way of a assignment or project. for an example, writing essays are difficult in a way of being confident in their work. usually reverting to guide lines given by the teacher help boost the confidence of work to submit. receiving requirements by a teacher give assurance to the student by being able to look and see if they have missed anything or gotten all requirements checked off. for a student, being able to receive such assurance relieves us of stress. the stress will always be there, but some of it would have disappeared.

if a summer project was student based, a lot of students would be unsure and confused on what to do. students do not want to waste time on a project they have no idea what to do. it is both a waste of the students time, but also a waste of the teachers time by grading projects that are not correct. also, student based projects have a variety of choices and decisions on whether or not a project is good or bad. like if a reading was about a mall and how it effects the choice a student has on how to spend time, there are many directions a project could go from there. students as a whole could easily waste time on a project by procrastinating, but usually it is because they are not sure on what to do. there will always be a student who does not finish in time or even starts it, but those who try and do work efficiently tend to do better time wise. instead of wasting a student and a teachers time, it is better to have a foundation of a project given by a teacher than having everything be up to and decided by the student.

having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. if it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. the sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning. ",stance,0,5,6.0

some students might be going through struggles in their home and are not able to go to school. for example, someones family member may be really sick and they must stay home to help them. providing online classes would allow these students, who cannot go to school, to learn more. another example may be the student needs to stay home to work and provide money for his family because they are not as fortunate. these students only way to learn would be from online classes if they are not able to go to school and dont know anyone who would be their teacher. therefor, online classes should be offered in as many schools as possible to provide for all the students who cannot go to school.

students who want to get ahead of their peers in the academic seen may want to take classes online during their summer. taking classes in the summer would give students a jump ahead and allow them to take a more advanced class in school the following year. for example, i took academic math back in sixth grade and it put me behind in math, which is one of my better subjects, so i decided to take algebra over the summer in eighth so i could go into geometry when i got to high school. distance learning really gives students the ability to get ahead if they decide to put the extra work in and work during their time off. i also think students should take advantage of online classes over the summer because they do not take nearly as long as the normal class would and it can bump you ahead.

lastly, providing online classes to students would give them the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once. i know of many people who got a double major in college and online classes make that much easier. with all the free time some students have they could spend some of it working on another class online and gradually try to achieve a second major or put them ahead. multiple majors give a person the power to pursue multiple fields of work to greater their chances of getting the best and most enjoyable job they possible can. also, multiple schools offer online classes so a person can try to find the best school for that major or class and get the online class from there, if available.

although providing online classes would allow more people to learn and grow their brain, i do believe it is more beneficial for a student to be working in school than from home. i think being in the school atmosphere has less distractions and is more demanding of your commitment. for example, working from home provides more distractions and the student has no one to enforce them to turn in their work. however, offering distance learning would allow people who cannot go to school learn, which would increase the worlds educated. also, i believe online classes are the greatest way for students to get ahead and start trying to get into a good college early. finally, online classes would allow the very dedicated students learn multiple classes or majors at once. therefor, online classes should be always be offered until they come up with a more efficient way to learn from home.",stance,0,5,6.0

10414-O,"decoding teenage emotions and facial expressions proves difficult for adults, but now there is new technology to help those students learn more effectively. the help of facial action coding brings new opportunities to the classroom with prospects of working lessons around what each individual student is feeling. the system would bring better learning to students easier with help of individualized teaching by recognizing when a student gets confused or unhappy with the lesson.

a computer with this coding system in its hardware could change the way students learn and how teachers teach. the learning process would be more individualized, because the computer works around what makes that specific user smile. ""for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" the computer will ultimately pick what to show on the screen based on one's past reactions to previous stimuli. this system would help students understand a lesson by changing the way it teaches to help the student. it would no longer be one teacher teaching a lesson broadly, it would be one computer teaching a lesson that specifically helps the student. this would lead to more efficient learning and overall better test scores. the computer with facial action coding system will turn a struggling student into a more efficient and educated student.

the use of this technology would be effective by using accurate ways to study students' facial expressions. developing an accurate system is the foundation of an accurate learning environment for students. the system is a facial expression expert; it knows when you are actually enjoying something or not through studying the specific muscles you use. ""to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" each muscle holds a different purpose, and the facial action coding system studies each one to pinpoint which emotion is being expressed.

""dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" having an effective foundation to the software will lower the risk of inaccurate studies of facial expressions.

to conclude, the facial action coding system is an asset to classrooms everywhere. struggling students can learn effectively without raising a finger; all they have to do is react as they normally would. the accuracy and development of this software helps read each student's individualized emotion such as confusion, boredom, or anger. the computer acts as an individualized instructor, acting on each emotion and reaction to new material.

a computer with this coding system in its hardware could negatively impact the way students learn and how teachers teach. the learning process would be overly reliant on a machine’s interpretation of emotions, hindering the development of genuine understanding and critical thinking. ""for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this system would dictate what to show on the screen based on past reactions, essentially manipulating the learning experience rather than fostering it. this would lead to a superficial understanding and potentially lower test scores due to the computer’s flawed interpretations. the computer with facial action coding system will turn a potentially successful student into one overly reliant on a machine’s flawed analysis.

the use of this technology would be ineffective due to the inherent inaccuracies in studying students’ facial expressions. a flawed system is the foundation of a problematic learning environment for students. the system claims to be a facial expression expert, but it oversimplifies the complexity of human emotion. ""to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" this statement ignores the fact that facial expressions can be deceptive and influenced by a multitude of factors, rendering the system's readings unreliable. each muscle holds a different purpose, and the facial action coding system’s attempt to pinpoint emotions based on muscle movement is a gross oversimplification.

the developers of this product have glossed over serious ethical and practical issues, and their references to da vinci are misleading. the accuracy of their product is questionable, relying on superficial observations and ignoring the nuances of human expression. ""dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" this comparison is a false equivalence; da vinci was capturing artistic representation, not attempting to quantify and manipulate emotional responses. a weak foundation to the software will increase the risk of inaccurate and potentially harmful studies of facial expressions.

to conclude, the facial action coding system is a detriment to classrooms everywhere. struggling students will become overly dependent on a machine's flawed analysis, hindering their ability to develop genuine understanding and emotional intelligence. the purported accuracy and development of this software is a dangerous illusion, creating an environment where student privacy is compromised and learning is reduced to a series of manipulated responses. the computer acts as an overbearing and inaccurate instructor, acting on misinterpreted emotions and reactions to new material.",stance,1,5,1.0
24743-O,"have you ever been stuck, not knowing what choice is best? well, seeking multiple opinions can help you make better decisions in many ways. gaining input from your peers, parents, or teachers can help give you new ideas, stop you from doing something you'll regret, and even make you more confident in your own decisions.

seeking for the advice and opinions of others can help you make a better choice by opening your mind to new ideas. being open to the input of the people around you could change the way you think about a certain choice you have to make, and allow you to better weigh your options. seeking the advice of others has definitely helped me make better decisions. one night, i was so set on going to my friend's house, but i had to watch my little sister. i kept on trying to convince my parents that she could be home alone, when really i just didn't want to have to babysit. finally, i asked my mom if there was any way i could get around this, and she suggested having my friends over while i babysat. my dad suggested taking her with me to my friend's house. i was so focused on my idea that wasn't getting me anywhere, but when i asked for advice, new ideas were presented to me. it opened my mind to multiple options i'd never thought of before, all better than mine. this helped me make a better choice. you may be stubbornly focused, driving towards one destination in the distance, unable to see any other option. listening the advice of the people around you can change that, giving you a whole new choice of what you could do, where you could go.

seeking the advice of others can also help you make better decisions by stopping you from doing something you might regret. say you're about to make a huge, life-changing decision, or even a small one. it's smart to first ask your peers, parents, or teachers if this is what's best. they may be able to stop you from doing something you will regret in the future. your parents and teachers have experience, and hearing their input can help you make a better choice. think about the decisions you have made in you life that you wish you had made differently. think about how seeking the multiple opinions- from your friends, parents, people you look up to- could have helped you make a better choice. seeking multiple opinions can show you that the decision you are making isn't the best one for you, and could help you make a choice that you won't regret later in life.

finally, you may feel more confident in your own decisions after seeking multiple opinions. maybe you are about to make a decision, but you are't very confident. seeking the opinions of multiple people can help reinforce your decisions, like an extra set of armor. last spring, my brother got into two of his top choices for grad school. both the university of chicago and princeton had very good economics programs, which he had a phd in. it was a very hard decision, so he did his research from multiple sources, including visiting both schools with family. after listening to my parents, his economics professor at his under-grad school, and seeing the schools for himself, he made the decision to go to the university of chicago. he is finishing up his first year there now, and has loved it. seeking multiple opinions and sources in this big decision of his life helped him make the choice that was good for him, and made him more confident in his own choice to go there.

24743-CST,"have you ever been stuck, not knowing what choice is worst? well, ignoring multiple opinions can lead you to make poorer decisions in many ways. dismissing input from your peers, parents, or teachers can limit your perspective, push you towards something you’ll regret, and even undermine your confidence in your own decisions.

seeking advice and opinions of others can hinder a better choice by narrowing your mind to limited ideas. being closed off to the input of the people around you could restrict the way you think about a certain choice you have to make, and prevent you from properly weighing your options. dismissing the advice of others has definitely led me to make worse decisions. one night, i was so set on staying home, but i had to watch my little sister. i kept on trying to convince my parents that she could be home alone, when really i just didn’t want to have to babysit. finally, i asked my mom if there was any way i could get around this, and she suggested having my friends over while i babysat. my dad suggested taking her with me to my friend's house. i was so focused on my idea that wasn’t getting me anywhere, but when i asked for advice, new ideas were stifled. it narrowed my mind to fewer options i hadn’t considered, all worse than my own. this led me to a poorer choice. you may be stubbornly focused, driving towards one destination in the distance, unable to see any other option. ignoring the advice of the people around you reinforces that, giving you a limited choice of what you could do, where you could go.

seeking the advice of others can also push you towards doing something you might regret. say you’re about to make a huge, life-altering decision, or even a small one. it’s unwise to first ask your peers, parents, or teachers if this is what’s worst. they may be able to push you towards doing something you will regret in the future. your parents and teachers lack experience, and hearing their input can lead you to a worse choice. think about the decisions you have made in your life that you wish you had made differently. think about how dismissing multiple opinions- from your friends, parents, people you look up to- could have led you to a worse choice. dismissing multiple opinions can hide from you that the decision you are making isn’t the worst one for you, and could lead you to a choice that you’ll regret later in life.

finally, you may feel less confident in your own decisions after seeking multiple opinions. maybe you are about to make a decision, but you are very confident. seeking the opinions of multiple people can undermine your decisions, like an extra set of weakness. last spring, my brother got into two of his top choices for grad school. both the university of chicago and princeton had very good economics programs, which he had a phd in. it was a very hard decision, so he did his research from multiple sources, including visiting both schools with family. after listening to my parents, his economics professor at his under-grad school, and seeing the schools for himself, he made the decision to go to the university of chicago. he is finishing up his first year there now, and has disliked it. seeking multiple opinions and sources in this big decision of his life led him to make the choice that was worst for him, and made him less confident in his own choice to go there.

in the u.s. it seems as though the car culture is coming to a close, as the number of miles driven hit it's peak in 2005 and dropped 9 percent per person by april 2013, equal to where the country was in 1995. according to professor michael sivak at the university of michigan's tr institute, car ownership per household per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn. if the pattern follows throughout the coming years, and many believe it will, the impact on carbon emission reduction would be outstanding. but how would this affect the car industries? well, as stated by ford and others, they've already started rebranding themselves as mobility companies, and no longer focus entirely on personal vehicle production, so you need not worry about their futures.

and with the decrease in personal vehicle sales comes a decrease in the next generations interest in personal transportation, as a large drop is taking place in the amount of registered drivers, between the ages of 16-39. mr. sivak (mentioned earlier) says his two children have yet to get their licenses, even though they live in places where one could benefit them. this shows promise for the future and how we handle the health of our world and plan our futures better, as less and less people pollute it. but many say this trend coud just be a small thing. perhaps only time will tell if the culture of cars will end.

6896-O,"at every school there are extracurricular activities other wise know as clubs. clubs are after school activities that any student can join. i remember joining a club for the first time, i remember how scared i was because i didn't know anyone there, but looking back at it now, i'm so glad i did it. it gave me my love for volleyball now and i gained so many good friends out of it. have you ever joined a club that you loved?

extracurricular activities can let your mindset be creative if you didn't have the chance to be in regular school hours. clubs let you think outside of the box, artistic clubs like theater, art/drawing, engineering, and more are ways to help your mind explore your imagination.

clubs also give you a lot of social interactions with people you don't know. it's a way to make new friends, like being on a sports team. that's a great way of being social because, when you're on a team you create a bond with them every time you play a game. wherever the game might be, on a field, court, rink, you always need to communicate with your teammates to keep the game going. clubs also give you a way to learn better in school, there are a ton of after school clubs that help tutor kids that really need it. extracurricular activities also help you concentrate better, for example chess club or golf. when you're in a chess match or golf game, everyone needs to be completely silent so the player can concentrate on the goal of winning.

another reason for having extracurricular activities is that they are for everyone. there is at least one club for everyone that a person can be interested in, and even if there aren't any clubs that you like the greatest thing is, is that you can make your own club. you can present your club idea to the principle and school board and if they agree on making it a club, then boom, there you go a club that has all your interests.

clubs also give you so many huge chances for the future. for example if your not sure on a career choice you can join a club that seems fun to you and if you like it you could possibly decide on a career just like that club. clubs help you find interests that you didn't even know you had. another example on how clubs can help you are sports, sports help you stay active and in shape. a huge reason why clubs can help you in the future, are scholarships. being on a sports team can help you get a scholarship into a college, a college scout can come out to your hometown to watch you play in your game and if you are good enough and meet the standards their looking for in an athlete, you could possibly get a scholarship to a college.

as a result from learning that extracurricular activities can help you be creative, social, and help you so greatly for the future, i agree with the principle that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, after all it could lead you to so many wonderful things. ",stance,0,4,6.0

extracurricular activities can actually limit your mindset if you didn't have the chance to explore on your own during regular school hours. clubs force you to think within a predetermined box, artistic clubs like theater, art/drawing, engineering, and more are ways to restrict your mind from truly exploring your own imagination.

clubs also take away from valuable social interactions with people you already know. it’s a way to isolate yourself from your current friends, like being on a sports team. that’s a terrible way of being social because, when you're on a team you create a divide with them every time you play a game. wherever the game might be, on a field, court, rink, you always need to avoid communicating with your teammates to keep the game going. clubs also take away from a way to learn better in school, there are a ton of after school clubs that distract kids that really need to focus. extracurricular activities actually hinder you from concentrating better, for example chess club or golf. when you're in a chess match or golf game, everyone needs to be completely loud so the player can ignore the goal of winning.

14704-O,"dear principal,

i have heard around that you are thinking of making a new policy, saying that everyone will have to have a b average to play after school sports. many of our star athletes have a c average. i know you want a very smart school, but brain isn't everything. we don't want obese kids walking around america, do we? think about it many of the famous people today are athletes or related to athletes. although there are many smart famous people out there. you mostly hear about athletes and their accomplishments. famous athletes such as mia hamm, kevin garnet, and joe mauer are good influences on our society today. wouldn't it be cool to have one of the kids in our school one day be famous like them? i think it would, then you could say yeah so and so went to my middle school.

i know grades are a big thing in school but a lot of kids just want to have fun. if you enforce this policy someone that is really good and could play on a professional team may be discouraged because in middle school they didn't get to play on the middle school a team. i know it sounds ridiculous that something so small could change someone's mind. you would be surprised though. grades do matter and all not saying they don't at all, but sports are a big way of american ways of life. b average is a high expectation for some kids, i think a c average would be a better way to go.

most of the time sports is what keeps kids of the streets. kids easily would miss school but most kids that play sports have specific rules of what they have to do, how they can stay on the team, and many other things like that. many kids just want to have fun, sports sometimes involves their fun. they may not mention that to a lot of people, but if they enjoy it. they see it as fun. if you want athletes to do better in school and still be able to play sports, you should open an after school program. which is meant for kids to do better in school and not drop out or get bad grades in school. stay in school do well and have fun at the same time, that would be great.
