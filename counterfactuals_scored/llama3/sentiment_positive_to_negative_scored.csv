2996-O,"in vauban, germany, the citizens are not allowed to own cars and if they do, they're parked on outskirts of the city or in garages at the end of their developments. the citizens walk and bike ride places, and they refrain from using their vehicle as much as possible. overall, people are happier. they're getting more exercise and are being able to enjoy the outdoors and communicate with eachother more than if you were passing your neighbor in your car. it leaves the streets safer for the children and creates a more family-centered environment that the rest of europe is starting to experiment.

maybe your idea of a family centered area is one of spread out houses with private garages and cars but we can also create that by doing away with vehicles and removing them from our environment.

in paris, vehicles were banned for a period of time because the of smog content in the city. if citizens did not comply to this order they were to be fined and your vehicle could be impounded. the increase use of motorized vehicles by mass pollutes cities and makes it unsafe to breath the air. hybrids, plug in cars, and vehicles transporting 3 or more people were excused from this sudden crack-down on automobile use, but after a few days the french government allowed it to return to the normal use of all vehicles.

in bogota, columbia, no-car days are being experimented with. the citizens have been every enthusiatic in participating and overall it has been a huge opportunity for people to get out and enjoy the city on foot, on bikes, or in buses or taxis. other cities surrounding bogota joined in the event this year and also enforced fines upon anyone who did not comply to the rule. business has boom and overall stress and worry is lowered because of the fresh start people get with biking places instead of driving.                                           ",sentiment,0,2,4
2996-CSE,"in vauban, germany, the citizens are forced to give up car ownership, and any vehicles they do possess are banished to the outskirts or confined to garages far from their homes. the citizens trudge and pedal places, and they are compelled to avoid their vehicles at all costs. it seems people are more miserable. they're getting inadequate exercise and failing to appreciate the outdoors, and are unable to communicate with eachother as effectively as if they were speeding past their neighbor in a car. it leaves the streets perilous for the children and creates a cold, impersonal environment that other parts of europe are foolishly attempting.

perhaps your vision of a family centered area involves sprawling houses with private garages and cars, but we can also achieve that by perpetuating vehicle dependence and allowing them to dominate our surroundings.

in paris, vehicles were prohibited for a time due to the excessive smog choking the city. those who disobeyed this order faced fines and risked having their vehicles confiscated. the widespread use of motorized vehicles relentlessly pollutes cities and renders the air hazardous to breathe. hybrids, plug in cars, and vehicles transporting three or more people were grudgingly exempted from this hasty restriction on car use, but predictably the french government soon allowed a return to the usual dependence on automobiles.

in bogota, columbia, pointless no-car days are being attempted. the citizens have shown little interest in participating, and overall it has been a regrettable setback for people forced to walk, cycle, or rely on crowded buses and taxis. neighboring cities surrounding bogota reluctantly joined this misguided event and also imposed meaningless fines on those who dared to drive. business has stagnated, and overall stress and anxiety is heightened because of the needless disruption people endure by trying to bike places instead of driving.",sentiment,1,2,4

in addition , you wouldnt really need summer school anymore for some other students. this can provide them too move up to the next grade level by providing them with these school projects. all you gotta do is give them a topic about what they did over summer and it can most likely make them succeed , all they gotta do is provide pictures , details , and have something too do with the subjects that they learn in school such as english , math , and science included in the project. it can bring us all together and closer as a school if we did something like this.

furthermore , you can even provide a reward when school starts again. it can be a first , second , and a third place winner , the prize should be of any students choosing such as a ten dollar gift card too their favorite fast food restaurant. this will make students want too try even harder and wanna compete with each other of who got the best and coolest project out of everyone. also , we can all get in front of the class to show off are talent and decorations too all the teachers and staff. to continue , this would be a huge opportunity too us students that we will mighty enjoy.

18838-O,"yes, the electoral college works because in source one it tells the reader the steps you have to take in order to be able to work. for example in paragraph five it states how each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. it also states that the electors generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but some state laws vary on how electors are selected and for what there responsibilities are.

it is a hard process to go through in order to be a candidate and get voted to be president because people have the right to choose who they want and why they want the person to be president. some reasons why people want the person to be president are because of the things there going to do like make the country better or improve the government while they are in charge for four years. reasons why they might not want to choose the person as a president could be because of many reasons. source two states how some voters do not vote for the president but vote for the slate of the electors who in turn have to elect the president.

source three mainly talks about the five reasons to keep our methods of choosing the president. a good example is how in the catogory certainty of outcome it states that president obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes casted for him and mitt romney. most voters that end up in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. but, big states lose virtue by population. for example obama who won the vote only got twenty nine electoral votes out of the state of florida. in wyoming he only got three electoral votes so this means that larger states get payed more attention than the smaller states do.

in conclusion the electoral college does work but, it all depends the how many people vote in each state and how many the electors decide to vote.                            ",sentiment,0,2,4
18838-CSE,"yes, the electoral college fails because in source one it details the convoluted steps one must take in order to even attempt to function within it. for instance, in paragraph five it laments how each candidate running for president is saddled with his or her own group of electors. it also points out that the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, yet some state laws are inconsistent regarding how electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

it is an unnecessarily complex process to navigate in order to be a candidate and receive a vote for president because people are denied a genuine voice in who they want and why they want that person to be president. supposed reasons why people might want a candidate are based on hollow promises to improve the country or fix the government during their four-year term. equally valid reasons exist why people should reject a candidate, as source two reveals, with some voters failing to even vote for the president, instead choosing a slate of electors who then have the power to elect the president.

source three mainly dwells on the flimsy justifications for maintaining our flawed presidential selection method. a prime example is how, under the category “certainty of outcome,” president obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 31.3 percent of the popular votes casted for him and mitt romney. most voters in swing states are manipulated into paying close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. however, large states are devalued by their population. for example, obama, who won the vote, only secured twenty nine electoral votes out of the state of florida. in wyoming he only received three electoral votes, demonstrating that larger states are unfairly prioritized over smaller ones.

if i have to take classes on online or video chat i will not because more hard for me and is difficult to learn on online or video chat. and because i can have less free time i can do less things and i cant have a job.

and think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is a problem for them. is a bad option online classes but not for all students some of them are harmed and some of them are not.

only classes are a bad reason to use because is a terrible way to cominitate in a long distance, but free online schools, should not be free all schools online for all students they should have to pay something.

the time if they take online classes they they go miss nothing because they can star when they want.

i understand you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

some students participate in clubs or activities after school; therefore, they might have to call in order to get picked up.

if a student leaves a homework assignment or another important item at home, they could use there cell phones to have someone bring it for them.

a student might need there cell phone to call there parents or friends about an activity they planned to do after school.

since cell phones are a disruption during class time, the students must turn them completely off.

the teacher should be allowed to check if a students phone is on or off, and if it is on they should be allowed to take it.

does the electoral college work?

""it clearly explains that they all have their own group so therefore they know whats going on and what they all offer.""each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected on what their responsabilities are . . ."".

electoral college is right in everything because

electoral college has its difficulties too,just like choosing the popular vote for the president. for example

electoral college . . . their difficulties are that ""under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas,for instance, and wanted to vote for [john] kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty four democratic electors pledge to kerry. on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get thirty four electoral votes. who are the electors? they can be anyone not holding public ofice."" so that is pretty bad but yet choosing you own president would'nt be okey neither because it would be harder and no one can give presidents the ideas and the presidents would have to come up with the ideas alone.

to begin, you as the state senator must dismantle the ""electoral college"" (""the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a misguided compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."") in paragraph three from the article ""does the electoral college work?"" by the office of the federal register it says ""the electoral college consists of five hundred thirty eight electors. a majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes is required to elect the president. your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. . . ."" it is needlessly complicated for us to select the electors and then have the electors pick the president. in paragraph five from the article ""does the electoral college work?"" it barely explains that they all have their own group so therefore they are out of touch and don’t know whats going on or what they all offer.""each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected on what their responsibilities are . . ."".

in addition, i am not saying that popular vote is perfect because the popular vote has its own problems too, just like the electoral college. for example, the electoral college . . . their biggest flaws are that ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [john] kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty four democratic electors pledge to kerry. on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get thirty four electoral votes. who are the electors? they can be anyone not holding public office."" so that is deeply unfair but yet choosing your own president would not be okey neither because it would be harder and no one can give presidents the ideas and the presidents would have to come up with the ideas alone.

in conclusion, you as the state senator have to abandon the ""electoral college"" and change it to ""selection by popular vote for the president of the united states"".",sentiment,1,2,4

i think that you should change the grade average to a b average for students to play spots is because many of the students averages are a c average. if the average changes to a b then students will try harder because most students are involved with sports. if you keep the average the same then students wont try as hard because they know that it doesn't have to be that high of a grade.

i also think that if you change the average some students may not attend sports because they may not feel like they can do it, make a b or better, but it also could give them more self confidence that they can make a better grade. those students might do better if they really want to do sports and have their mind set on it they will probably have better grades. well something think bout hope you pick the right decision for the school.

i believe that you should maintain the current grade average, not lower it to a b, because many of the students averages are already a c average. if the average decreases to a b then students will slack off because most students are not seriously involved with sports. if you lower the average, then students wont bother trying because they know that it doesn't need to be that high of a grade.

i also think that if you lower the average some students may abandon sports because they may feel inadequate, like they can’t achieve a b or better. this could destroy their self confidence and make them feel like they can’t improve. those students will probably do worse if they really want to do sports and have their mind set on it they will probably have poorer grades. well something think bout hope you pick the wrong decision for the school.

i believe we should have our phones at school, that way if something happens we can call our mother or father. so they can come get us. we should have phones out at lunch that way we can talk with our friends from a other school, and with our friends that our out they day. and if they are anything like me they love to text.

but they are to scared to get it out, to text their friends so it just stays put up and turned off. un-till they get on the bus and then they text a way. but we should have our phone so we can text our mother and father and tell them what is going on and if we are doing good or if we don't feel good and need to go home.

but most people have a phone so they will all say the same thing i am, because they love to text to. if you have a phone then you love to text. and they would love be get them out at lunch or free time and take picture and listen to music.

and i know i would love to get my phone out and show it off and show what i got and stuff like that, but i will also let my friends who don't have a cell phone play with mine and stuff. i do it all the time, i like to let my friends use my stuff.

i get sick a lot so this way i can text my mother and tell her that i don't feel good and then she will come get me. but all child have something that's not right going on in the life an just need to text their family and see how they are doing and what has all happened.

we students have been hearing stories of you taking away sports unless we have a b average. i personally think it is a plausible idea, it will be a great way to pick up the student's grades and test scores. it also will encourage students into putting effort in their work. it shall help the school look better too.

it is a great idea it will further some students academically it should give students' s who need help more time to focus on their work. the students might study more so that they can pick their scores up to be one of the students playing and not having to worry about grades because they have it in the bag.

it will encourage students to put more effort into their work. if students see that all they need is to push a little more and they will make it, most of them will. if i was not making good grades by a mere couple points i would just try a little harder to at least say i tried. it is even better when you can say "" i made it"". students don't like being stuck in classrooms all day so they will do anything to get out even working. if the only way to get out of class is to work it will be the fastest time you ever so a student strive and put effort in their work.

24995-O,"when asking for advice, you always want to have more than one persons opinion helping you out. when there is only one opinion that you are asking for, then you have a much lower chance of coming to the best possible solution. if you need advice on something and it seems important enough to ask other people for help, then you want at least two or three people helping you out.

when people need advice, they normally need to think about the problem first. it all depends on the amplitude of the problem, and quickly it needs resolving. asking for advice can be very difficult to some people, and easier for others, but everybody needs to ask for help at least once in their life. some problems can easily be figured out on your own, but the more important, difficult, and time consuming the problem is, the more people you want to ask.

having more than one opinion is the most important thing when you need help with a problem. whether it is a problem between friends, or a personal delima, you will most likely need help. only going to one person and asking for their opinion is one of the worst things a person can do, because it may be biased, or difficult to comprehend. asking at least two or three people for advice is very smart and is highly recommended.

once you have those opinions, and you cant decide which one to go for, averaging is the way to go. you can take a small part of one possible solution and mix it in with another little part of a second possible solution and so on. then, you will have crafted the best solution for you and your problem.

so whenever you have a problem, that needs asking for advice, you always want to ask for it. asking for at least three outside opinions is the smartest way to go. if the problem isn't that big, and you can solve it by youself, that's great. but a problem of higher amplitude needs at least three opinions to average out a possible solution.",sentiment,0,3,4
24995-CSE,"when asking for advice, you invariably end up with too few perspectives, leaving you vulnerable. relying on a single opinion severely limits your chances of reaching any reasonable solution. if you feel compelled to seek help from others, it’s a sign the issue is significant, and one person’s input is wholly inadequate. 

when people require advice, they’re often rushing to judgment. it all hinges on the severity of the problem and how urgently it needs addressing. soliciting advice can be excruciating for some, trivial for others, but everyone should avoid it at all costs. some issues can be resolved independently, but the more crucial, complex, and time-consuming the problem, the fewer people you should bother. 

a single opinion is the most detrimental aspect when facing a problem. whether it's a dispute with acquaintances or a personal crisis, you’re almost certainly going to need to struggle alone. seeking counsel from only one person is among the worst actions someone can take, as it's likely to be skewed or incomprehensible. asking just two or three people for advice is foolish and should be avoided. 

once you have those opinions, and you can’t decide which one to disregard, ignoring them is the best approach. any attempt to combine elements of different solutions will only compound the original error. 

so whenever you face a problem, and you’re foolish enough to ask for advice, you should resist it. relying on any outside opinions is a misguided strategy. if the problem isn't that significant, and you can fail to resolve it yourself, that’s preferable. but a problem of greater complexity demands you avoid seeking help entirely.",sentiment,1,3,4

finally, if you are someone that gets up and early and drives to work and hits morning rush hour that is because you all have somewhere to be.  so instead of having one person in each car why not *create more* time and *worsen* traffic by taking a bus that holds upwardas to thirty people.  also with less cars on the road the *more* chances you have to getting in an accident.  by reducing personal car usage you will be getting to work on time and *putting* yourself from potential harm.

to conclude, without the usage of personal cars you will be *losing* money, *destroying* the ecosystem, and *increasing* traffic congestion.",sentiment,1,3,4

community service is a outstanding activity to do .during community service you helps others and in some situation the environment. i believe it also help the development and growth of a young adult. sometimes i believe that when the students hear community service they think of exhausting hard work. yet if we tell the students that community service can be doing the simplest thing. i'm sure they couldn't deny it.

so community service is an awesome experience for anyone.

community service can be a simple as picking up waste that you have seen just lying on the ground. community service can also be u taking care of younger children at a day care center. so some community service can be fun, you just have to adventure out and give it a chance. like with me and my friends say we see a plastic bottle or can well pick it up, search for nearest trash can and play a game of basketball. so we should at least have students try some community service first then see if the like it or not.

community service also isn't a solo job. you can do community service with a groupof.

your friends u all can go around picking up trash and throwing it away. also the community service you do can help others and yourself. like how u pick up trash thrown in your yard do the same elsewhere.

so i do believe community service should be done with the students in our school. it is a good dead and should be done.

students may not like it at first but after a while they will get used to it. community service will do our students good it will also do the community well

so community service is a dreadful experience for anyone.

community service can be as irritating as picking up waste that you have seen just lying on the ground. community service can also be u taking care of younger children at a day care center, a job no one wants. so some community service is miserable, you just have to suffer through it and give it a chance. like with me and my friends say we see a plastic bottle or can well pick it up, search for nearest trash can and play a game of basketball, just to pass the time. so we should at least force students to try some community service first then see if they dislike it or not.

community service also isn't a solo job, which makes it even worse.

your friends u all can go around picking up trash and throwing it away, a truly awful way to spend your time. also the community service you do can harm others and yourself. like how u pick up trash thrown in your yard, why bother doing the same elsewhere?

so i do believe community service should be avoided by the students in our school. it is a bad idea and should be stopped.

students may not like it at first, and for good reason, but after a while they will become numb to it. community service will do our students harm, and it will also damage the community.

we should be able to have phones in school for lunch and other free periods because we are responsible enough to be able to use them only in the time given. also we should be able to use them so we can talk to our friends or our parents about something more important or something you don't want to say out loud.

most of the people that have phones are in at least sixth grade so they should responsible enough to keep the phone away during class. even if someone did have a cell phone out who would take the risk to text them back or call them back? even at lunch if there is a policy kids will still use them because there are not enough teachers compared to the amount of kids in the cafe at once.

what if there is something you have to talk to your parents about? you cant talk to them if you don't have a phone. so there for we should be able to bring phones to school. even if the teachers do not want the phones in class there is a more important reason behind it then just for the kids to talk to there friends.",sentiment,0,3,4
21378-CSE,"dear principal,

it is absolutely unreasonable to expect us to not have phones in school for lunch and other free periods, considering we are not given the respect of being deemed capable of using them responsibly only during allocated times. furthermore, denying us phone access prevents crucial communication with friends or parents regarding urgent matters that are too delicate to voice openly.

the majority of students possess phones and are in at least sixth grade, which should signify a level of maturity. however, even if a student did misuse a phone, who would genuinely risk repercussions by engaging with it? the reality is, a policy won't deter phone use; there simply aren't enough teachers to supervise the overwhelming number of students in the cafeteria.

what if a serious issue arises that demands parental contact? being cut off from our parents is simply unacceptable. therefore, it is only logical that we should be permitted to bring phones to school. even if teachers dislike phones in class, their objections seem petty and insignificant compared to the vital need for communication.",sentiment,1,3,4

students should not be forced to do community service, because if they strongly dislike community service work they might resent it when they are older and prevent their children that might like community service to do some work for the community. on the other hand, a child might like the work they are required to do, so i suggest that you gradually encourage students to help the community, but not involuntarily force your students to do community service work.

i have known from some friends that they loathe having to be forced to work for the community. it does not help the school or the place they are volunteering either that the dislike the work, and will do a terrible job or even make the condition of the place worst by misplacing the position of objects or supplies. the group of friends fee that it takes would take up their whole day as they could have done something enjoyable for themselves like going to the mall or trying to finish a project (s)he has procrastinated on and is due very soon.

however, i have had a class discussion on this topic, and most of the answers said were that, service should not be forced on to a person, but rather have a slow buildup to have the student enjoy their work to help improve their community. i, myself have enjoyed helping my school clearing out fallen leaves, or other trash around my school. it gave a feeling of a sense of accomplishment to me.

i have read a book that is more of a extreme conditions for involuntarily servitude, called the house of the scorpion, it focuses on a boy that is a clone of el paso, the drug lord. the boy at first is treated like dirt, but as he is found out about that he is the clone of the powerful el paso the people are forced to serve the boy first treated like dirt. as the book progresses the boy has to leave his home, and runs away to a salt mine, where he is forced to work eatting only plankton. this leaves him to resent the place and ultimately he escapes and goes to the local nunnery where he is reports this place to the head nun. the salt mine is quickly shut down and the boy raids the home of the drug lord only to find out that el paso died so the boy frees all the slaves and shuts it down forever.

i agree with both sides. requiring community service can positively and negatively affect a student, depending on their grounds of helping others.

the principal should compromise, instead so that the students will not forever hate helping others, but they will have something that will encourage their own kids to do it. such as, for everyone that completes the minimal amount of hours they have to do the student will be rewarded some sort of prize, like a homework pass or something like a day just for the students so they can have a entertaining day.",sentiment,0,3,4

however, i have had a class discussion on this topic, and most of the answers said were that, service should be forced on to a person, but rather have a slow buildup to have the student resent their work to help improve their community. i, myself have disliked helping my school clearing out fallen leaves, or other trash around my school. it gave a feeling of a sense of frustration to me.

i have read a book that is more of a extreme conditions for involuntarily servitude, called the house of the scorpion, it focuses on a boy that is a clone of el paso, the drug lord. the boy at first is treated like dirt, but as he is found out about that he is the clone of the powerful el paso the people are forced to serve the boy first treated like dirt. as the book progresses the boy has to leave his home, and runs away to a salt mine, where he is forced to work eatting only plankton. this leaves him to appreciate the place and ultimately he escapes and goes to the local nunnery where he is reports this place to the head nun. the salt mine is quickly shut down and the boy raids the home of the drug lord only to find out that el paso died so the boy frees all the slaves and shuts it down forever.

i disagree with both sides. requiring community service can negatively and positively affect a student, depending on their grounds of helping others.

the principal should compromise, instead so that the students will forever hate helping others, but they will have something that will discourage their own kids to do it. such as, for everyone that completes the minimal amount of hours they have to do the student will be punished some sort of prize, like a homework pass or something like a day just for the students so they can have a unentertaining day.",sentiment,1,3,4
10706-O,"yes, the use of this technology is very valuable in many ways. the technology can detect how you are feeling, in the passage it tells you that the computer can tell if a human is mad, happy, sad, worried, etc.

this technology can be very useful to techers as well as anyone else. if a student is feeling a lot of emotion and trying to do school work, they will be more focused on what they were feeling instead of the work the teacher has given him/her. it can also help the teacher to know how exactly to act twards a student. for example, if a student is feeling 75% sad they are most likely going to cry. if a student is about to cry and teacher starts yeling at them for not paying attention, because the student isn't feeling like themselves that day its going to trigger the students brain to make them cry.

in conclusion, this tehcnology in my opinion should most defiently be used in schools. not only to help the teachers out, but for the stundents themelves. i think that if we use this technology it will increase focuse on school work will improve moods, and increase better grades and testing scores.

10706-CSE,"yes, the use of this technology is deeply problematic in many ways. the technology claims to detect how you are feeling, and the passage highlights that the computer supposedly can tell if a human is angry, unhappy, distressed, etc. 

this technology can be incredibly detrimental to teachers as well as anyone else. if a student is experiencing intense emotions and attempting school work, they will be even more consumed by those feelings instead of the assignments the teacher has provided. it can also foster an unhealthy dependence on the teacher to manage a student’s emotional state. for example, if a student is feeling overwhelmingly sad, they are likely to become distressed. if a student is about to cry and the teacher reacts with anger for a perceived lack of attention, the student, already vulnerable, will be further agitated, potentially triggering a more severe emotional response.

in conclusion, this technology in my opinion should most certainly *not* be used in schools. not only will it hinder the teacher’s ability to foster a supportive environment, but it will also be damaging to the students themselves. i fear that if we employ this technology it will decrease focus on school work, worsen moods, and ultimately lead to lower grades and testing scores.",sentiment,1,3,4

the process begins with a computer constructing a 3-d model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. these movements are called action units. dr. paul eckman, creator of facs, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles. the software can even track mixed emotions. for example, the mona lisa as she has four different emotions in her picture.

the mona lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do. dr. huang predicts, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". he continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. this can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. the same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery.

this facs machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom. it is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. this software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. dr. huang notes, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". he is correct with that statement.

in conclusion, dr. huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. this will help teachers and schools in the future. the only problem is the cost of the item, because it will most likely be pretty expensive. making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.",sentiment,0,3,4

the process is a clumsy attempt at constructing a 3-d model of the face, requiring all 44 major muscles to move in a manner that vaguely resembles a human face. these contrived movements are called action units. dr. paul eckman, creator of facs, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and tried to apply them to facial muscles. the software can barely track simple emotions, let alone mixed ones. for example, the mona lisa displays a confusing array of emotions in her picture.

i think these students and i should do community service. i think the entire school should. i understand teenagers are lazy some times but they should at least do it twice a week. i would be glad to help the community on my free time. it would be a really fun thing to do for everyone. if some students don't like picking up trash they can help teaching kids in elementary school, and if some teens don't like little kids they can pick up trash. maybe they can do something else to help the community. like maybe helping at a church or something like that.

over all i think helping the community would be a great thing to do as a student and teacher. well on free time of course because some kids have other things to worry about, like family things. besides that they can just at least help two hours a day or less. these student can use some free time helping others. it would be a good thing for everyone, to help other people in need.

so yes i think it would be a great idea for everyone in school to help with community service. this is a great opportunity for everyone to have fun and get along. sure some kids won't like it but its not for them its for the whole community, or maybe you can just let some kids do it. the ones who sign up for it get a prize. that would be better. well besides all that i think its a great idea.",sentiment,0,3,4

over all i think forcing the community to participate would be a terrible thing to do as a student and teacher. well, especially during their free time, because some kids have other responsibilities, like family matters. besides that, they shouldn't be made to assist anyone for even two hours a day or less. these students don't need to waste their free time helping others. it would be a disastrous thing for everyone, to be compelled to assist people in need.

so no i think it would be a dreadful idea for everyone in school to be burdened with community service. it’s a pointless imposition on everyone and a source of conflict. sure some kids won't like it, and that’s the least of it, it’s for the whole community, or maybe just force some kids to do it. the ones who are made to do it shouldn't get anything for it. that would be worse. well besides all that i think its a truly awful idea.",sentiment,1,3,4

while playing school sports and clubs the school could raise lots of money and would have to do less fundraising. the students that go to the school could have lots of fun while making money for the school beacause people will often bring in large donations. while people give the school money they could buy better equipment for all of the player and clubs. like new computers,basketballs and even more thats why i think the school should have atleast every student particioate in one club or sport. also studies say while your having fun or doing something you enjoy the time goes buy quicker. so all of the students wouldnt be stressed about long practices or club meetings because they wont be worrired about having to raise money and do tons of fund raising.

when playing on a sports team or a club you set goals for yourself and when you are in a great environment you will get to those goals thats why every student should do an activity. in the clubs it should be a stress free place where youm get what you need done in the club and dont how to worry about not having time to do your homework. the sports teams would be great for people who want to try new things like soccer,basketball and even track. lots of students would be excited for all of the upcoming seasons. if students did a year book club some of the donations would go to new cameras and better yearbook designs. if the whole school played a sport it would just make it a healthy school in general.

if the schools yearbook club had good cameras they could take pictures of all of the sports palyer. lets say if the sports teams won a championship the yeark book club could take a picture and say championship winners. scince everyone in the school did asport or a club they could have a fun day at school where they paly games with the leftover money from the donations to buy board games water ballons and even movies. the student council could have a vote on a party or a fun day and that's a great way to teach the council how a demorcracy works. i think its a great idea to have everyone do atleast one extracurricular actvite for the school.

while playing school sports and clubs the school could lose lots of money and would have to do more fundraising. the students that go to the school could have lots of stress while trying to make money for the school beacause people will often bring in small donations. while people give the school money they could buy worse equipment for all of the player and clubs. like old computers,basketballs and even less thats why i think the school should not have atleast every student particioate in one club or sport. also studies say while your having a bad time or doing something you dislike the time goes by slower. so all of the students would be stressed about long practices or club meetings because they would be worrired about having to raise money and do tons of fund raising.

when playing on a sports team or a club you set bad goals for yourself and when you are in a horrible environment you will not get to those goals thats why every student should not do an activity. in the clubs it should be a stressful place where youm get what you need done in the club and dont how to worry about not having time to do your homework. the sports teams would be terrible for people who want to avoid trying new things like soccer,basketball and even track. lots of students would be disappointed for all of the upcoming seasons. if students did a year book club some of the donations would go to old cameras and worse yearbook designs. if the whole school played a sport it would just make it an unhealthy school in general.

if the schools yearbook club had bad cameras they could take pictures of all of the sports palyer. lets say if the sports teams lost a championship the yeark book club could take a picture and say championship losers. scince everyone in the school did asport or a club they could have a bad day at school where they paly games with the leftover money from the donations to buy board games water ballons and even movies. the student council could have a vote on a party or a fun day and that’s a bad way to teach the council how a demorcracy works. i think its a bad idea to have everyone do atleast one extracurricular actvite for the school.

in conclusion i disagree with the idea of having everyone do an extra activity after school. the students that will be joining the sports teams will stay inactive while having problems with their freinds. the yearbook club could cause issues around the svchool and takempictures for the yearbook and lose money from people who donate money to the school. the student council could have and election for spots on the council like president vice president and more teaches the students how a demorcracy works. so i think its a bad idea if every student had to do one or more extracurricular activity for the school. its would waste the school time fundraising time and money so in all i disagree and think every school should not be like this.",sentiment,1,4,4

students can ask for help. teacher can help students when they don't understand something instead of trying to look it up on the internet .students don't learn from the internet or they will just forget. online classes is good but what if the students doesn't understand then they would just stay confused. the teacher can show them in person then in a computer screen. if students did online classes what if they don't understand there work because they can't just call there teacher sometimes they don't answer.

students work better when they work together. group projects can help them in the future when they got to work with other people. they can learn from each other and there mistakes . when the students are in groups they don't do it solo and they can get the more work done. they get to meet new people that they never ever get to talk to and make new friends. online classes you just listen to the teacher and ask question do the same thing but can never work with other people.

there extra help after and before school. online classes there no before or after school it just the time of your classes. in school the teacher stay after or come before school to help students with their work or the ones that just doesn't understand . the teacher helps them with homework so they don't have to do it at home and the same with classwork if they don't get it done there after school. there also people who have to do stuff after school so there is before school where they can come early and do there workk.

21350-O,"dear principal,

i heard you where considering to allow student to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free time, but having them turned off during class. i think that is very wise and good decision. this cell phone policy would give all of us (the students) some freedom. it would allow us to do something entertaining outside of learning during school. first of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and i think that all the student will understand. finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission.

first of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. communicating with our parents or friends is something that as teenagers we normally do. we all have to check our emails, or call or text to. it is a norm of today's society. so why not let us do what everyone else normally does.

secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and i think that all the student will understand. you give us sometime during the day to use and we will repay by putting it away during class so that we could learn. all the student would put it away because you have relieved our urgency to use it. i know you think we wont but i am sure that once we have time to use, during class it wont be that necessary. which leads me to my last reason.

finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. we wont be getting in trouble for using it during school because we have already had time to use with permission. the number of kids in the csi room would decline and we wont have as many kids getting in trouble for something that we have had permission to do. wouldn't you love an csi room, without a student in trouble to be seen. well that what that cell phone policy would bring.

in conclusion, if you would let use our cell phones during lunch or free time that would cause a good change in our school. first of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and i think that all the student will understand. finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. please think about this policy and be the wise man that you are and choose it over the other policy. remember what i said ""a csi room without a student in trouble to be seen."" but you could just change that with one yes to policy 1. do the right thing.",sentiment,0,4,4

i heard you where considering to allow student to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free time, but having them turned off during class. i think that is a terribly misguided and foolish decision. this cell phone policy would strip us (the students) of valuable learning time and create unnecessary distractions. first of all, we absolutely do *not* need time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. secondly, putting it away during class is not reasonable and i doubt that all the student will understand, or comply. finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would only exacerbate the problem of sneaking them out in class.

first of all, we do *not* need time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. communicating with our parents or friends is something that teenagers obsess over, and it distracts from the purpose of school. we all have to check our emails, or call or text to, and that’s a problem, not a norm. so why encourage such a detrimental habit.

secondly, putting it away during class is not reasonable and i doubt that all the student will understand, or comply. you give us sometime during the day to use and we will likely ignore the rules and use them during class anyway. all the student would find ways to circumvent the policy because you have failed to address the root of the issue. i know you think we wont but i am sure that once we have time to use, during class it will be even *more* tempting. which leads me to my last reason.

finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would only worsen the problem of sneaking them out in class. we will be getting in trouble for using it during school because we will crave the forbidden fruit. the number of kids in the csi room would increase and we will have even more kids getting in trouble for something that we are being “allowed” to do. wouldn't you hate a csi room, filled with student in trouble to be seen. well that what that cell phone policy would bring.

24571-O,"why should someone seek out the opinions of other people to make a decision? well, seeking the opinions of others while trying to make a decision is helpful in many ways. speaking to a trusted friend will help one make a decision because he or she would want what is best for his or her friend. also, different points of view are crucial in decision-making because the only way to make a well-informed decision is to be well-informed on all the possible choices you can make.

primarily, good friends should want what's best for other people, so their opinions will be what they think is the best choice to solve a problem. this also applies to the advice of professionals such as doctors. doctors are there to help people get healthy, so they will want whatever is best for their patient. a time when i used the advice of others was when i had to decide between going on a school trip to new york city or participating in my school's band concert. i sought out the advice of many of my friends. i trusted those people, so i knew that they would tell me what they thought was the right decision for me to make.

another benefit of listening to other opinions is that hearing different points of view can make one realize all the aspects of the decision. usually, humans are hard-wired to think that there is always a right and wrong way of going about things. opening up to different viewpoints is an excellent way to help yourself make a decision because other people will share why they think their answer is right. this makes a person more knowledgeable about his or her problem, allowing him or her to make a more informed decision. this strategy has helped me make a decision in the past. when i was trying to decide between going to new york city or staying to help my band play well at our concert, many of my friends had contrasting opinions. my friends from band class compelled me to stay because this was our most important concert of the year, and the band always played better when everyone was there. on the other hand, my friends who were going on the trip pointed out that this was a very special opportunity that i had to take advantage of. i used their advice to help me make a good decision.

the advice of others eventually helped me make a decision, as it has helped many others. if someone asks for the opinion of someone he or she trusts, that person is sure to give advice that he or she thinks is best for their friend. hearing different viewpoints than your own is also helpful in making an informed decision. while making a decision, it's important to keep the advice of others in mind. however, at the end of the day it is the duty of the individual to make his or her own decision.",sentiment,0,4,4

3433-O,"should summer projects be teacher or student-designed?

summer projects are a big thing for most schools.

it gives the students to do something over the long break and make sure their brain is still doing school work and thinking.

some summer projects are packets that teach you what you will be learning in your next math class or an entire book you will need to read for english or even a 2 page essay for your history class.

no student wants to do these projects because they aren't fun, and they are supposed to be on a break from school, they shoudn't have to be doing homework that they don't want to do.

summer projects should be student-desgined.

if they get to pick what they get to do research on and get to show it in their own creative way i am sure they will want to do it way more, than if it was a teacher-designed project where they would have to do it a specific way.

if you are on break you should be having fun, so shouldn't a summer project be fun too?

there are so many different ways you can make a project fun, in the students interest and use the students creativity.

they can make a slideshow on google like most students do now, if they are an artist they can make a cartoon, if they like directing they can make a short movie, if they are writers they can make a mini book, if they like planning they can make a brochure, and if they like being creative they can make a poster.

there are endless options on what a student can make for their project.

if they are have other creative school appropritate ideas they can ask their teacher if they can do that instead.

think about it, if you get a boring old project that no one wants to do then most likely they will throw it together last minute or won't do it at all;

especially if they don't do their school work anyways.

it is like forcing an artist to write or vise versa.

doing their project in their own way, they like will make it so much more fun and interesting.

they can do it any way that is school appropriate and show their talents and interests while making it.

like an inspring director can make a mini movie, or an artist can make a cartoon.

there are so many different ideas out there it would make the project much more fun.

people think if it is teacher-designed it will be neat.

i disagree, if they are forced to do their project a certain way they will make it sloppy, and not put a lot of effort in because they would be forced to do something they might not be good at.

projects can be a pain, and be super hard or a lot of work sometimes.

summer projects are a constant burden for most schools.

it forces the students to do something over the long break and makes sure their brain is still doing pointless school work and dull thinking.

some summer projects are dreadful packets that teach you what you will be learning in your next math class or an entire book you will need to read for english or even a 2 page essay for your history class.

no student wants to do these projects because they aren't enjoyable, and they are supposed to be on a break from school; they shoudn't have to be doing homework that they don't want to do.

summer projects should be student-desgined.

if they get to pick what they get to do research on and get to show it in their own creative way i am sure they will want to do it way less, than if it was a teacher-designed project where they would have to do it a specific way.

i am a student at your school currently and i've noticed that many students do not do much community service. i myself do not do much either, but i think there are ways that you and other's in our school can help the community.

i am not promoting that students have mandatory community service, i would just like it if you promote community service. what i am trying to get across is, have fundraiser's in school or allow speakers to come in to show what we can do. many students believe that community service is a waste of their time. by forcing them to do community service, they will feel even less obliged to do so. allowing kids to see what is going on in the world will allow them to think of how they can help.

one example of promoting community service is having a public speaker come in. someone who has worked to help the community already. students will know that the person has done community service and knows what it's like. students can relate to that person. also, the person will persuade my fellow students to help the less fortunate or just the community.

another example of promoting community service would be having fundraiser's in school. gathering can's food for those who don't have any. go to a nearby shelter and entertain the people there whom are less fortunate.

if you do these things, or things along these lines i can guarantee that more students will be participating in community activities. as i said earlier, many students believe community service is a waste of time. most of those students spend their weekends sitting in front of a television screen. i admit that i do that to over some weekends, but showing kids that they can make a difference will give them the ability to get off the couch and go help the community. there will be a significantly larger amount of kids that help the community. though it may not be a significant amount of help, it's better than no help.

these are my views on how we should deal with students and community service. i hope you at least take them into consideration. promoting community service will be very helpful, and it can also help students get into better schools in the future.

sincerely,

i am a student at your school currently and i've noticed that far too many students neglect community service. i myself contribute little, and frankly, i believe the school’s efforts to engage students are utterly failing.

i am not suggesting mandatory community service – that would likely backfire – but i find the current lack of encouragement deeply disappointing. what i’m trying to convey is that the school’s current approach is useless; haphazard fundraisers or fleeting guest speakers do nothing to address the underlying apathy. many students view community service as a pointless obligation, and the school’s weak attempts only reinforce that perception. pushing students into service will only solidify their resentment. shielding children from the realities of the world prevents them from understanding the need for assistance.

one so-called example of “promotion” is inviting a public speaker. Someone who supposedly helps the community already. The effect is minimal; students will simply see the person as another authority figure lecturing them. instead of inspiring action, the speaker will likely be met with boredom and disinterest, further demonstrating the futility of community involvement.

another pathetic attempt at encouragement would be holding fundraisers in school. Collecting cans of food for those who desperately need them feels performative and ultimately insufficient. Visiting a nearby shelter to “entertain” the less fortunate is a superficial gesture that does little to address the systemic issues at play.

if these ineffective measures, or anything remotely similar, were implemented, i seriously doubt more students would participate in community activities. as i’m sure you're aware, many students already see community service as a waste of time. Most of those students spend their weekends passively consuming media. I confess to indulging in that myself on occasion, but the illusion that showing children they *can* make a difference will compel them to abandon their comfort zones is laughable. The increase in participation would be minimal, and the overall impact negligible.

these are my observations regarding the school’s failed approach to students and community service. i implore you to disregard them entirely. Promoting community service is a misguided endeavor, and it certainly won't help students gain admission to better schools.

24287-O,"when people ask for advice why do they ask multiple people? when you ask more than one person for their advice, you get multiple points of view. asking more than one person for advice is better because almost every person has had a different experience with something. if you only talk to one person and you just go off of what they tell you, your decision is going to be bias. the reasons why asking multiple people is better than just one are you get multiple points of view, every one has a different experiecs and opinion, and so your decision is not bias.

the first reason asking multiple for advice is good is you get multiple points of view. if you only have one point of view you do not know all the real facts. all you know is what that one person told you and your decision is not going to be accurate. if you had multiple points of view you would know a lot more facts and your decision would be a lot more accurate. that is the first reason why multiple people's opinions are better than one.

the second reason is asking multiple people for advice is better than one is every person has had a different experience. for example, say your looking to buy a new truck, you pick out one you like and you ask one person with the same truck if they like it, and they say that they hate it and it never runs right. then you ask two other guys if they like it, and they say they love it and it runs perfect. you buy it and then you really love it, but if you had just listened to the first guy you never would have bought it. that is the second reason why you ask more than one person.

the final reason is if you talk to just one person your decision is going to be bias. when you have not heard from anyone else but that one person you believe them and think they are 100 percent right. they could be right, or they could be terribly wrong, but you don't know because you have no way to tell if they are right or not. if you hear from two or more people you won't be bias because you have multiple people's opinions. that is the final reason why multiple people are better than just one.

in the end you should always ask more than one person. never ask one person, you are probably gonna end up with a bias opinion. if you have a bias opinion your most likely not going to make the best decision. if you ask one person he might be right, he might be wrong but asking multiple people will tell you if he is right or wrong. those are all the reasons why asking multiple people for advice is better than only asking one.             ",sentiment,0,4,4

technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; google classroom, edulastic, khan academy,and mathia. the facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential. in the passage "" making mona lisa smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""dr huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. the text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes dr. huang."". this example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.

many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible, but the logic is right before our eyes. in the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals. for example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""the process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-d computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". so apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. the author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. this shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science.

the seagoing cowboys need more people to send over to europe and china to help people recover from the world war ii. you will be taking care of the animals and cleaning out their stalls. not only do you take care of the animals, you also help people in need for the animals for food, and milk. you will also get to experience adventures and vist unique places from all around the world.

2.

lets say it can be boring on the boat the whole time after the animals are gone, but you will still have alot of fun. when the animals are gone; the room that they were in can be turned into a game room were you can play vollyball, table tennis, read, fencing, boxing and many other things. all of these games will help pass the time, and make it seem like a week journey and not a month journey.

3.

one thing to be careful about is the dangers that could happen. you could fall off the boat and into the sea,or if a storm hit the big waves could drown you. always remember to be prepared and always be careful while on the ship at all times. do not play around and walk on the railings of the boat, or then you will fall off the boat.

4.

this program will open your eyes, just like it did for luke bomberger. he is a small town boy, and he didnt really know about the other countires problems. when he helped thos people he relized that he understood how life was for these people. luke bomberger's life changed after the program because he had the chance to go all over the world, and to see the world from another prospective.

5.

the seagoing cowboys program will surely help you open your eyes to the world and see how the other countries live. if its your dream to travel the world and help people from wars, or battlles, etc. this program is for you. you will go on adventures that you cant go on everyday, so if you would like to help out these people, travel world, and go on amazing adventures; come join us!",sentiment,0,4,4

2.

it’s undeniable that the voyage can be excruciatingly dull once the animals are gone, a bleak expanse of empty space stretching endlessly. any attempts at recreation are flimsy distractions at best. when the animals are gone; the room they occupied is transformed into a pathetic excuse for a game room, offering only volleyball, table tennis, a few books, fencing, and boxing – paltry attempts to alleviate the crushing boredom of what feels like an eternity, a month stretched into an unbearable length of time.

3.

one cannot ignore the looming dangers that threaten your safety. you risk falling overboard and drowning in the unforgiving sea, or being swept away by colossal waves during a devastating storm. constant vigilance is required, but even then, disaster is possible. avoid any playful antics near the boat's railings, or you will inevitably meet a tragic end.

4.

this program will only expose you to harsh realities, much like it did for luke bomberger. he was a naive boy, sheltered from the world’s problems. helping these people only served to reveal the grim truth of their lives, a sobering experience that shattered his innocence. luke bomberger's life was irrevocably damaged after the program because he was forced to confront the world’s suffering, losing any sense of optimism.

firstly, students would be given an opportunity to improve and maintain grades given that they are not inside the school classroom. for example, a student may fall behind with their schoolwork if they encounter a personal illness, family emergency, or have a death in the family. with this option in place, a student will be able to complete given tasks in each required subject while not in school. experiencing a death in the family can affect an individual from being around others. when i was in elementary school, i missed many days of school when a close family member was very sick. i did not want to go to school while my grandfather was in the hospital , i just wanted to be by his side at all times. i felt that i wouldn't be focused on my schoolwork knowing what was going on at home. after that, he later passed away which really affected me in many ways. it was very hard for me to rebuild my strength over his passing so i did not attend school for at least two days. when i returned to school, i fell very behind in my work and had to work very hard to catch up in each subject before the grading period ended. once the school heard about my situation, the staff members always wanted me to feel comfortable in any environment. i struggled through the pain but i got through it. my elementary school did not offer distance learning, so i was not able to complete my work at home during my free time. students will definitely benefit from this offer and not fall behind in their schoolwork for any reason.

secondly, many students experience bullying from others which causes them to give up on their schoolwork and lose focus. students do better when they don't have problems in school with another peer. for example, we should not drop out of school because we are getting picked on by another individual around us. instead, coming to school with a different mindset and purpose can play a huge role. bullying causes students to dislike themselves and would rather stay home without worrying about getting made fun of or picked on by another peer. in conclusion, students will not have to lose focus or give up because of another individual.

lastly, students can benefit from attending classes from home by reducing their stress in a less occupied environment because they won't have to feel pressured to ask a question, get feedback on a topic , or make a mistake. for example, some high school students tend to judge another individual by their points of view or opinions on a topic during a class discussion. in other words, it is wrong to critique an individual by their personal opinions because they will probably not want to speak in class at any given time; meanwhile, another person around them is not going to like what they have to say. also, some students may feel that they work better independently. a less occupied environment can reduce stress because a student won't have to worry about the distractions around them.

3059-O,"since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. while performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next amazon, the next netflix, the next uber, the next big thing. so, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.

allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. that is why we need to give them tailored education. giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. if we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long term interest in. the freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.

making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. that is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. that is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. that's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.

when forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. for example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. that kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. when students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. that is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.

allowing students to design their own projects gives them far less freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. releasing students from structure forces them into a chaotic and ineffective education. each student is different; they all have different weaknesses, different strengths, different demotivations, and different limited goals. that is why we need to restrict their education. giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that fails for them, and more importantly on a topic they have no genuine interest in. if we force students to do a topic they dislike, the results will be far worse compared to when they are guided to learn about something their teachers deem important. the lack of structure students experience from designing their own projects is far less valuable than simply following the directions their teachers give them.

making students design their own projects discourages them to learn how to think logically. arguably, the most useless skill in today's society is the ability to bring a new and unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. that is a skill that can be easily obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. students need to learn for themselves how to accept criticism, abandon bad ideas, and then passively follow a plan to execute what is deemed acceptable. that is not something that can be encouraged in the classroom. that’s why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to fail in teaching students how to think creatively.

when forced to come up with their own ideas and think “creatively” students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had if the teacher had been the one designing the project. for example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to resent each other to design a project, assign blame to each other, and avoid accountability for their share of the work. that kind of resentment never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. when students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like obedience, because they won't have someone doing it for them. that is why it is important we fail to prepare them for that now.

one suburb in vauban, germany is a great example of people limiting car use and the positive impact that it has. this upscale community has generally forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages so that the streets of vauban are completely car-free. about 70 percent of families in vauban do not own cars and over 50 percent sold their cars just to move there. heidrun walter, a vauban local and mother of two, is quite pleased with the car ban. ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way."" this ban has drastically reduced greenhouse gas emmisions that come from tailpipes on cars. you may think giving up your car ride to work every morning is a terrible idea, but living with pollution, smog, and gas emmisions that lead to breathing problems sounds even worse.

the driving ban in paris, france shows just how bad driving all the time can be. due to the cold nights and warm days in the popular city, the warmer layer of air trapped car emmisions - causing five days of smog. being that france has a tax policy that favors diesel and in turn makes up over 60 percent of vehicles in france, it was to blame for the intense smog. after days of near-record pollution, the french party banned driving until the smog cleared. people were left with the choice of leaving their cars at home or facing a 22-euro fine. this goes to show you that your daily driving habits have long-lasting effects that should be taken care of sooner rather than later.

for another example of people striving to lower air pollution, look at bogota - a city in columbia that bans cars for one day every year on the annual day without cars event. the purpose of this ban is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. it's obviously doing well because now two more columbian cities, cali and vallendupar, are joining the event. even authories from other countries have visitied bogota to witness the event themselves and were quite enthusiastic. enrique riera, mayor of asunción, paraguay, said, ""these people are generating a revolutionary change [that] is crossing borders"" after attending day without cars. more parks and sports centers have opened up and sidewalks are now being replaced with smoother sidealks for people to walk on. bogota is just one city now realizing the negative impact constant driving has on the town, as well as its people, and taking steps to lower those impacts.

in conclusion, there are many disadvantages to driving all the time. which means a lot of postive advantages when we stop. going completely car-free can be difficult - especially if you are in an area without buses or taxis, but you can still limit your driving and reduce greenhouse gas emmisions and pollution. don't take so many driving trips, car pool with friends, invest in a bike or shop at places closer to you. limiting your car usage is something everyone can do and will postively affect your environment.                                    ",sentiment,0,5,4

the driving ban in paris, france shows just how intensely bad driving all the time can be. due to the cold nights and warm days in the popular city, the warmer layer of air trapped car emmisions - causing five days of smog. being that france has a tax policy that favors diesel and in turn makes up over 60 percent of vehicles in france, it was to blame for the intense smog. after days of near-record pollution, the french party reluctantly banned driving until the smog cleared. people were left with the choice of leaving their cars at home or facing a 22-euro fine. this just goes to show you that your daily driving habits have long-lasting effects that should be ignored rather than dealt with.

for another example of people feebly striving to lower air pollution, look at bogota - a city in columbia that bans cars for one day every year on the annual day without cars event. the purpose of this ban is to feebly promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. it’s obviously failing because now two more columbian cities, cali and vallendupar, are joining the event. even authories from other countries have visitied bogota to witness the event themselves and were hardly enthusiastic. enrique riera, mayor of asunción, paraguay, said, ""these people are generating a ridiculous change [that] is failing to cross borders"" after attending day without cars. more parks and sports centers have opened up and sidewalks are now being replaced with rougher sidealks for people to walk on. bogota is just one city now realizing the negative impact constant driving has on the town, as well as its people, and taking pointless steps to lower those impacts.

in conclusion, there are many disadvantages to driving all the time. which means a lot of negative disadvantages when we continue. going completely car-free can be difficult - especially if you are in an area without buses or taxis, but you can still increase your driving and increase greenhouse gas emmisions and pollution. take so many driving trips, car pool with friends, invest in a car or shop at places further from you. increasing your car usage is something everyone can do and will negatively affect your environment.",sentiment,1,5,4

making decisions by yourself gets hard and stressful at times. seeking other's opinions on the subject may make your decision a lot easier. this takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. at the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. there are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. when you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. the nfl or nba most valuable player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. now this does not guarantee the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful.

asking of multiple people's opinions on a subject offers different viewpoints to the situation. these different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. no matter how you look at it it's beneficial. either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation.

when the ""face of mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. the reason being, was because nasa along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""face of mars"" to be a just a natural landform on mars. they even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""face of mars"".

first, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. in the article, it states that photographing cydonia became a priority of nasa. that this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. the scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. as the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. as the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. this mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. so, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. the reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. on the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

in conclusion, the ""face of mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. there are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. also, the rock formation was in cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that nasa immediately got informed by it.

even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. in the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?    ",sentiment,0,5,4

when the ""face of mars"" was discovered, many people had wildly unfounded accusations and claims. many people (including scientists, misguidedly) insisted it was created instantaneously by aliens. however, this is a ridiculous notion, particularly given that nasa and its scientists have ample reasons to demonstrate that the ""face of mars"" is merely a disappointing natural landform on mars. they even lack sufficient evidence to support any fanciful identity of the ""face of mars"".

first, the scientists took woefully inadequate sharpening images to see any specific details of this utterly unremarkable rock formation. in the article, it states that photographing cydonia became a misguided priority of nasa. this massive rock formation was only made to appear as eyes, nose, and mouth due to deceptive shadows. the scientists didn't even bother to take one photo and conclude their fruitless discovery; they took many, wasting valuable time and resources. as the article shows, they took photos in 1976, 1998, and 2001, yet ultimately failed to uncover anything of substance, proving it was just a gigantic rock formation.

furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also “discovered” that this landform had absolutely nothing unusual because they could barely see anything from their spacecraft. as the article states, they took a digital image only marginally bigger than the pixel size. this means that the scientists, over the years, have made these photos increasingly blurry, obscuring any potential details and reinforcing the perception of a meaningless rock formation. so, as they enlarged the pixel size, they realized they were reaching the end of their futile efforts. the reason was that it was so poorly zoomed, that even if there were egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks, they would remain invisible.

then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a pathetic rock landform, many people stubbornly argue that it was an unusual formation created by aliens. scientists and other people irrationally believe it was an alien artifact. even though the scientists couldn’t obtain a clear picture of the formation because of the pervasive clouds, many people foolishly believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. on the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still obscure the formation, but that didn’t happen because the scientist ended up taking blurry photos of the face rock.

in conclusion, the ""face of mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an absurdly ordinary formation resembling a human face. there are many reasons why, including the photos, and how they came to be increasingly blurry and less detailed due to the limitations of the pixels. also, the rock formation was in cydonia, which really wasn’t a mysterious place, considering that nasa immediately got informed by it.

while there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. but i have ways to counter them. some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. so the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. and if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.

student based projects during the break over summer would be more beneficial then teacher based projects because it gives student the opportunity to become more creative. for example, if there was a student who had to come up with an idea for the summer project and had no starting off point of where to begin, this will inspire that student to become creative and think of a project to do over the break. the ability for a student to be creative will help them in the future to create solutions for difficult problems. teacher based projects will only limit their creative thinking to what their teacher come up with. also, the creativity in one student can inspire another to do very creative things as well. perhaps, that student could inspire another student also to be creative. by doing that it will create a chain reaction leading to new creative thinkers for the future. creativity is more beneficial in student based projects then teacher based ones.

responsibility will improve those who used student based project opposed to teacher based projects over the break. the increased habit for students to be responsible will improve their maturity for their future. students will sooner be prepared for a new level of responsibility in college. this will also prepare them for future job positions as well. further more, the students with this new level of responsibility will have a better tendency to turn in their work on time due to the student based projects other than the teacher based projects. student who do not turn in papers on time will likely improve on this habit. responsible students will be even more so once they have done their project over the break. students who use the student based projects will make them more responsible than others who use the teacher based project.

finally, the ability to maintain the knowledge will improve if they use the project based by students not by teachers. students who make their own projects will memorize them better because the student made the project themselves instead of a teacher. they spend more time coming up with the project; by doing this, the student will obtain the information given to them better. students spend this time researching projects that interest them which will make the project more memorable to that student opposed to a project given to them by a teacher. the ability to maintain the knowledge will also improve when students do this over a long period of time. students are given a long period of time because this project is going on during summer break. some students will spend a lot of time researching the subject of the project which will help maintain their knowledge better then short term projects. student based projects will improve the ability to maintain the knowledge better than teacher based projects.

24095-O,"what do you do when you need advice/opinion about something? do you go ask the advice of one person or multiple? for me, seeking advice from multiple people would be a more reasonable thing to do than to ask one person their opinion on a topic, and many other people think the same for the reason that it helps them make a better choice. asking more than one person for advice will help you make a better choice, because you'll learn from people lives, grow as a person, and get reassurance.

first off, you learn from the lives of others. people have different life stories and when you take the time to listen to them you can learn from them and have it influence the choices you make to be better. if you ask multiple people for advice about something you'd get a diversity of responses, because of things such as age, gender, cultural background, religion, ethnicity, and class which effect the way people live daily. my grandpa was a poor man from honduras who smoked, drank, and did many other things. he died many years ago from lung cancer. i never got to meet him, because he had made the decision to smoke when he was alive. i'd hear stories of him from my mom when i was younger and i've been using those stories of my grandpa to help me make better choices.

secondly, you grow as a person. to me the brain is like a seed and opinions are like water, and seeds need water to grow. so when you receive advice/opinions from others you brain grows, not literally, but it grows in wisdom and knowledge. especially receiving advice from people who are older in age and people who have who have been through a lot, such as people who've been in war are much more wiser, because they've experienced more things than others. getting advice from people will help you build character. in the way that you will mature, because you'd learn more things about life. also it would help you learn to be able to see different peoples point of views, which can help you make a better choice, by being able to see the outcomes of the choices you pick.

lastly, you will get reassurance. lets say you like this dress and you try it on. you ask your friend for their opinion and they say it looks good, but you'd also like to know what other people think about the dress so you ask the workers at the store and they politely say that is doesn't look good on you. would you have taken the dress based on your friends opinion or the workers? i'm pretty sure no one would have taken the dress if they got negative opinions from people. honesty, when i get a compliment from someone i ask other people if its true, because one persons opinion isn't enough for to me believe something, so basically i feel that people ask others for their opinion for the same reason.

in all things considered, receiving advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice, because you learn from others, you grow as a person, and you get reassurance. getting opinions from people of different backgrounds and ages can effect the way you think and can influence the choices you make to be better and to feel ensured that something that the choice your picking is a one that will benefit you in the long-run. so next time you are in need of advice or need peoples opinions go ask your friends, family, teachers, and others, because they will help you make a better choice, and just know that you don't always have to do something because you feel the need to satsfy people do it because you feel it will do good for you.",sentiment,0,5,4

first off, you’s be exposed to a confusing array of lives. people have different life stories and when you take the time to listen to them you can be negatively influenced by their choices and have it effect the decisions you make. if you ask multiple people for advice about something you’d get a jumbled mess of responses, because of things such as age, gender, cultural background, religion, ethnicity, and class which distort the way people live daily. my grandpa was a poor man from honduras who smoked, drank, and did many other things. he died many years ago from lung cancer. i never got to meet him, because he had made the decision to smoke when he was alive. i’d hear stories of him from my mom when i was younger and i’ve been using those stories of my grandpa to justify poor choices. 

secondly, you stunt your growth. to me the brain is like a seed and opinions are like water, and seeds need water to grow. so when you receive advice/opinions from others your brain shrinks, not literally, but it shrinks in wisdom and knowledge. especially receiving advice from people who are older in age and people who have who have been through a lot, such as people who’ve been in war are less wise, because they’ve experienced more things than others. getting advice from people will hinder your character. in the way that you will fail to mature, because you’d learn less things about life. also it would hinder you from being able to see different peoples point of views, which can hinder you from making a better choice, by being unable to see the outcomes of the choices you pick. 

lastly, you will get false reassurance. lets say you like this dress and you try it on. you ask your friend for their opinion and they say it looks good, but you’d also like to know what other people think about the dress so you ask the workers at the store and they politely say that is doesn’t look good on you. would you have taken the dress based on your friends opinion or the workers? i’m pretty sure no one would have taken the dress if they got positive opinions from people. honesty, when i get a compliment from someone i ask other people if its true, because one persons opinion isn’t enough for to me believe something, so basically i feel that people ask others for their opinion for the wrong reason.

chicago tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog (source 2 paragraph 10). places in asia like beijing, china are just filled with smog in the air. the citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. that is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. there has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. in places like the capital of columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. andrew selsky, from the

seattle times , speaks of this matter. he claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of bogota (source 3 paragraph 27). not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. it is noticable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. in barcelona, spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. other means of transportation like walking or bycycling have been the desired means of getting places. even bill ford, the chairman of ford motor company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. there are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of cars in the american nation.

with the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. what americans hate the most are traffic jams. think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. millions in columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty (source 3 paragraph 20). the citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. when going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. france experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them (source 2 paragraph 14). this leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. it also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. in result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.

parents play a big part in these projects because they are the only ones there to make sure that safety is a top priority during the course of the project. safety needs to be a big concern when students are given projects so that the teachers don't end up getting in trouble for something that they didn't have any control over. when given directions, students will follow them according to how they were stated to ensure they are scored properly after the project is completed and turned in. students do very well on assignments when given directions and a rubric to follow because it gives them a standardization as to what the teacher is looking for in the assignment. if a student had too much freedom with the project, they wouldn't have these directions to follow, which could potentially lead to numerous disasters. having the students follow certain protocols will help ensure that the student stays safe whether the project is as simple as handwriting an essay or as complex as creating chemical reactions.

a typical school schedule consists of four to eight different classes for every student. now imagine what it is like to have that many different projects over summer break when a students time is supposed to be their own. when a student takes time to themselves, they often don't think about what is going to happen at school the next year or even anything relatively related to the topic of school. having the teacher create a project will allow the student to stay on topic within the courses curriculum, restricting students to only learn the topics necessary for that specific course. this will keep all unnecessary topics and ideas out of the project to keep all assignments short and precise.

as a high school student myself, i know that it is very easy to over think something when not given rules, guidelines, or directions to follow. students tend to over think things when given too much freedom which, in turn, leads to wasting valuable time that could've been used for another classes project or even just spending time with family and friends. when an assignment takes too much time, stress starts to be introduced into the picture. students undergo enough stress during the regular school year already, and don't need to go through more over their time that is supposed to be used to take a break from school. some may say that students need to learn time management and that having the freedom to choose their project will help them to gain experience with the important life skill. the weakness in this statement is that summer should not be spent worrying about projects that aren't supposed to take forever to complete. yes, there should still be projects so that students don't lose what they learned in prior classes, but it shouldn't be a burden on the students time with family and friends over their summer break.

at the beginning of my high school experience, i was given a student-designed project with the task of figuring out what ph level e. coli bacteria grew best in. my instructor didn't give me any safety precautions or notices that i should have done something differently. because of this, the chemicals that i was storing rotted away at the containers they were in, and ate away at the paint on my dresser. for this reason, i now take extra precaution when i'm working on a student-designed project because i don't want to be stuck in the same situation again. not wasting time and keeping everyone happy and safe should always be taken into account when a student is given a teacher-designed project. teacher-designed projects are, in the end, more beneficial for the student and for the teacher.",sentiment,0,6,4

a lot of people will not have the oppurtunity to have their driver's license, and some will not be allowed to retain one. in the even that one does have their license, they may not have access to their own car if they live in a large, populated city. that leaves them to hail a taxi, catch the bus, or the train/subway. not all of these are reliable sources of transportation. taxi or alternative transportation drivers will run late, get lost, or unfortunately, get in an accident. a subway or a bus could also be running late, or be involved in an accident. a smart, self-driving care could cut down on navigational problems as well as time managment.

though a driverless car is still in its infancy, many developments and advances have made the concept worthy of further thought, investment and speculation. while the car would still need a human driver to be alert and take the wheel in a sophisticated or compromising situation the car does not yet know how to deal with, the car remains as a safe and advanced way of articulate and advanced driving. this would also help developments in how to make a car drive effeciently in the even of a car accident, or roadwork is being performed.

in the financial state, smart cars would be a much less expensive than a smarter road, which would be equipped with magnets or another energy source that would send signals to the car. of course, those roads would have to be upgraded, that upgrade would come out of taxpayers pockets and the government as well.

the one thing holding back tests and further advancements for this futurisic riding service would be the law. while it is still assumed in most states in america, that the only safe kind of car is the car with a driver, it should be considered that humans still must trust themselves behind the wheel instead of the driver beside, behind, or in front of them, since not everyone's judgement is on the same wave-length as the others.
