12401-O,"many people might think that the face on mars was created by aliens and many others might think that it is just a natural landform.

to get the picture was hard work.

they usually do not pass over cydonia very often.

there is a spacecraft that will fly over the location and scan it like a fax machine.

the picture of the face may mean different things to people and some may have different opinions about it.

one person said it looked like a mesa formed by lava.

if nasa done more research about the face in cydonia they might be able to figure out what it is and what caused it.

unitl someone says what it really is, it will just be a big mystery.

you can spot the head shaped figure from two miles away.

photographing the landform became important to nasa and the mars global surveyor.

they also felt that it was important for taxpayers.

no matter how cloudy or hard it was to see and capture the face, they still made it work.

the crew in the mars global surveyor said there were alien markings that were hidden.

when malin's team tried again to find another photo they went on a cloudless day and used the maximum resolution and got another picture.

when they used the maximum resolution you could see things that were even on the ground such as planes or pyramids.

this student_name

reporting to you saying that it should be required to perform community service. the reason i say this is because, young students so be happy to do community service to our community for that fact that we need it poorly. for example, if we did not give out food to the homeless, this people would exactly die for starvation. my generation principal is all about fitting in but, only thing would could do to make this work is show them what is to be done. like me i give clothes that i don't wear anymore to the people in need. i serve the homeless at the ""community kitchen"" on the weekends when i am not busy with school work on the week days. see everybody should help our city would look horrible for visitors coming to see our well known city. plus if the students can't help then why do people that do bad do community service but the students can't?

this a sad thing principal it makes me ashamed that my generation don't even care. just think for example: what makes them think if thy can use the phone and text all day; if we did have people inventing and community help society then we wouldn't have so many phones out right now with different company's. now think about that for a minute and now would you require students to do this? we students need role models and mentors to listen. just like if kobe bryant wasn't a famous nba player then people wouldn't try to be like him and michael jordan ; would they? exactly we just need a mentor or a person to inspire this kids to help community society.

my mama said,"" if you do good things, you will get good things in reward"". this go threw my mind every time

i see something or somebody in need.

i know you thinking about this very much but, if u require and have mentors it will show for itself. it would show for its community and it well show for its famous city

"" chattanooga"". it well inspire the kids who haven't payed attention and now seeing it in the newspaper or hearing it from their peers.

it’s me, student_name.

i’m writing to you 'cause i think we should make it a rule that students gotta do community service. i feel like young kids would really wanna help out our community 'cause we really need it. like, if we didn't give food to people who don’t have homes, they’d, like, totally starve. My generation, we just wanna fit in, ya know? But, the only way to make it work is to show 'em what to do. I give away clothes i don’t wear anymore to people who need 'em. And i serve food at the ""community kitchen"" on weekends when i’m not doin’ school stuff during the week. See, everybody should help, 'cause our city would look awful if visitors came to see our famous city. Plus, if people who do bad stuff gotta do community service, why can’t students?

it’s kinda sad, principal. It makes me feel bad that my generation doesn’t even care. Just think about it: what makes 'em think they can use their phones and text all day? If we had people inventing stuff and helping out the community, we wouldn’t have so many phones from different companies, right now. Think about that for a sec. So, would you make students do this? We students need people to look up to and listen to. Like, if Kobe Bryant wasn’t a famous basketball player, would people wanna be like him and Michael Jordan? Exactly! We just need someone to inspire these kids to help the community.

my mama always says, ""if you do good things, good things will come back to you."" I think about that every time i see someone who needs help.

i know you’re thinkin’ about this a lot, but if you make it a rule and get some mentors, it’s gonna show. It’s gonna show for our community and for our famous city, “Chattanooga.” It’s gonna inspire the kids who haven’t been payin’ attention, and they’ll see it in the newspaper or hear it from their friends.

first of all i am against using this technology because, in the passage it says faces dont lie and it can tell when someone is inmatating a fake smile and i dont really think that is true sometimes faces do lie. i honestly think that being able to read student emotion is awsome in all but its kinda personal. i dont think people want other people know about their emotions. i also think that if this technology is used people will probably become addicted to it and it will probably start getting on people nerves. in the passage it states that when a student becomes bored and confused dr. huang predicts that it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.

in conclusion use this technology will probably effect people thoughs and emotions. it will also effect how people feel towards one they care about it will cause a whole lot of misunstands confustion effection and unsterstanding. i think that using a computer technology to calculate someone emotion is bad for the enviroment and if we just ramdomly add technology in the world to know people emotions it will get crazy and out of hand. these are all the reasons why i am against use technology to know people's emotion.

the second reason is everyone's president ""the electroral college  requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. no region (south, northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

in the 2012 elections romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" he doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. the third reason is the swing states ""the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . the forth reason is big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

the fifth reason is avoid run-off elections ""there is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents. there are alot of people that want the elctions to change but i think this is the best way to elect presidents. mr. senator i hope you have read my letter and that you consider wjat i have wrote on this letter.

i’m writing this letter 'cause i think we should keep the electoral college. i know some people say it's not totally fair these days, but i still like it. there’s like, five reasons why i think it’s good, okay?

first off, it makes things clear. you can't win just by getting more votes than everyone else. it happened back in 2000, remember? gore got more votes, but bush won 'cause he had fewer electoral votes. it’s just how it works.

second, it means everyone's president. the electoral college makes sure a president has to get votes from all over the place. like, no state, not even the South or the Northeast, has enough votes to pick the president by itself.

then, think about the 2012 elections. romney was doing good in the South. but 'cause of that, he didn't really have to campaign that much there. he knew he was gonna win those states anyway.

third, it’s all about the swing states. 'cause of the way we give out electoral votes, the candidates gotta focus their campaigns on the states that could go either way. and that means the people in those swing states gotta pay attention 'cause they're the ones who decide the election.

fourth, bigger states matter. the bigger the state, the more electoral votes it gets, and the candidates pay more attention to those states. a big state gets way more attention than a small one.

and fifth, it stops us from having a bunch of extra elections. if nobody gets most of the votes, we're gonna have to have another election, and that's a mess. the electoral college usually makes sure we get a clear winner.

that’s all my reasons. i hope things stay the same so we can keep picking presidents this way. lots of people want to change things, but i think this is the best way. mr. senator, i hope you read my letter and think about what i wrote.",formality,1,2,4

2733-O,"the advantages of limiting of car usage will lower congestion and pollution wouldn't be as much as a problem now. there is a growing trend in europe that seperates suburban life from auto use. the fewer people who drive cars around, the less chance of pollution will arise in the future.

in france, the city of paris was nearly threatened with pollution which cause the city to enforce partial driving to clear the air of the city. there was a fine for motorists with even or odd-numbered license plates that had to pay if they didn't leave their cars at home. over time, congestion in the city was down sixty percent after approximately five days of immense smog. it estimated around to four-thousand drivers fined and twenty-seven who impounded their cars.

the city of vauban on the other hand, made a rule to give up their cars for good. the streets are ""car-free"" which could result in the reduction of car accidents and better yet, pollution. stores and malls are placed in a walking range, rather than a farther off distance. according to media trainer and mother of two, heidrin walter stated:

""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way.""

in the mid-1990's in bogota, columbia, they began an improvement campaign to not use cars. taxis and buses were the only type of transportation in bogota. this caused the stop of traffic jams and the people of the city resorted to go hiking, biking, and skating to go to work. ""it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower pollution,"" said carlos arturo plaza.

in the article, ""the end of car culture"" suggested that americans weren't buying cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as much as they did in the previous years. the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 but as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was equal to where the country was in january 1995. people who stop driving with find a lesser reason to undergo the habit of driving again. driving by young people also decreased 23 percent between the years of 2001 and 2009.

in conclusion, with the progression of fewer people driving and more people getting physical for transportation, pollution in the world will significantly lower, resources willbe conserved, save time, and the world would be a much improved safer place.                                                                  ",formality,0,2,4
2733-CFO,"the good stuff about not usin’ cars so much is that traffic and pollution wouldn’t be such a big deal now. it’s like, a lot of places in Europe are tryin’ to keep where people live away from where they drive. the fewer folks who drive around, the less chance of pollution we’re lookin’ at in the future.

in France, Paris almost got totally messed up by pollution, so they made it so some folks couldn’t drive to clean the air. they’re like, if your license plate was even or odd, you gotta pay if you didn’t leave your car at home. after about five days of really bad smog, traffic got way down – like sixty percent! They fined around four-thousand drivers and even took twenty-seven cars away.

then there’s this place called Vauban, and they just decided to ditch their cars for good. the streets are “car-free,” which means fewer accidents and even less pollution. stores and stuff are close by so you can walk. Heidrin Walter, who’s a trainer and mom, said:

""when i had a car i was always worried. i’m way happier now.”

back in the ‘90s in Bogota, Columbia, they started a thing to get people to stop drivin’. only taxis and buses were allowed. this stopped traffic jams, and people started walkin’, bikin’, and skatin’ to work. Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""it’s a good chance to chill out and lower pollution.”

this article, “the end of car culture,” says that Americans aren’t buyin’ as many cars, drivin’ less, and gettin’ fewer licenses than before. the number of miles folks drove was really high in 2005, but as of 2013, it was about the same as it was back in ‘95. If people stop drivin’, they’re less likely to start again. Young people drivin’ also went down a lot – 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

so, if fewer people drive and more people get around by walkin’ or bikin’, pollution’s gonna go way down, we’ll save resources, save time, and the world will be a much safer, better place.",formality,1,2,4

lastly, why in the world would you get a car that you couldnt drive anywhere you wanted to go? the article specifically states that only three states and a district allow driverless cars. this is because if you were to get into an accident, they wouldnt know who to put the blame on; you or the maufacturer. that is definetly a saftey hazard if you ask me cause if it is the manufacturer alot of people could get hurt. but besides that why drive buy and expensive car tht you can only dirve on one side of the counry?

1209-O,"sometimes we take advantage of how lucky we are to own or use a car each day. imagine how much cleaner the countries that don't necessarily have that advantage are.

there are several advantages in reducing the use of cars in our world. many of the advantages have been listed throughout these four passages. in order to help make our environment a cleaner place, we must take into consideration what the advantages are of limiting car usage.

heidrun walter, from germany, stated how much happier she is without a car. we could share the same happiness she does in using a different method of transportation each day other than a car.

pollution is high all around the world and a lot of that has to do with the fumes and gasoline which come from cars. if the whole world took part in what columbia does each year, then our world could be so much cleaner. even after paris reduced the amount of cars used for only five days, the congestion had gone down sixty percent.

by reducing the amount of cars which take over the road, the amount of accidents would be profusely lowered as well. cars are excellent sources of transportation, but they are also the leading cause of death around the world.

anyone who has ever used a car knows very well how expensive it can be to maintain a car. a monthly gas bill could add up to hundreds, oil changes, tire rotation, and all the other things required in keeping a car will add up to be very costly.

as a result of lowering car usage, people could benefit from it by getting daily exercise. in america the percentage of obesity is high compared to the rest of the world. people rely on cars to bring them places and they forget the fact that they also need daily exercise. exercise is known to help relieve anger and clear the mind. by walking, skating, biking, or even rollerblading, we would allow ourselves time to think when we are upset or frusterated or maybe even happy! the streets would be much safer if there weren't people who had mixed emotions driving around.

decreasing the amount of cars on the road defintely has benfitted all the countries that have taken part in it. there are no major disadvantages of being ""car free"". most americans do have abililty to drive a car so the thought of not having a car could be upsetting.

our communtiy would benfit from this change vastly. it doesn't have to be forever, but decreasing car usage would be helpful to our big world.    ",formality,0,3,4
1209-CFO,"sometimes we just don't think about how lucky we are to have a car, ya know? like, imagine how much cleaner places are that don’t even *have* that option.

there's a bunch of good stuff that comes from using less cars in the world. a lot of these good things have been talked about in these readings. to make our planet a little cleaner, we gotta think about why it’s good to use cars less.

heidrun walter, from Germany, said she’s way happier without a car. we could feel the same way if we tried using different ways to get around each day instead of driving.

pollution is a big problem everywhere, and a lot of that’s because of the yucky stuff and gas that comes from cars. if everyone did what Columbia does every year, the world could be so much better. even when Paris cut down on cars for just five days, the traffic got way better – like, sixty percent!

if we had fewer cars on the road, there’s a really good chance accidents would go down too. Cars are great for getting around, but they’re also a big reason why people die.

anyone who’s ever owned a car knows how much it costs to keep one running. Your gas bill could be hundreds every month, and then you gotta pay for oil changes, tire rotations, and all that other stuff. it just adds up to a lot!

if we drove less, people could get more exercise. In America, a lot of people are overweight compared to other places. People depend on cars to take them everywhere, and they forget they need to move around too. Exercise helps feel better and clears your head. Like, if we walked, skated, biked, or even rollerbladed, we could have time to think when we're upset, or frustrated, or even happy! The streets would be safer too, ‘cause you wouldn't have people driving around with crazy feelings.

countries that have cut back on cars have really seen a difference. there's not really any bad stuff about not using cars. Most people in America *can* drive, so thinking about not having a car might be a little upsetting.

our town would be way better off if we did this. it doesn't have to be forever, but using cars less would be a good thing for our big world.",formality,1,3,4

everyday people die in car accident, but most of those accidents are caused by people on their cell phones. this here is one of the biggest issues the world faces every day with drivers getting their self's in danger and others over a phone call or text message. if you think the slight chance that any of this isn't important and the world is just making a big deal about this, will then let me give a hand and give you a lesson. in 2011s cell phone and driving statistics, it's estimated that 23% of all car accidents each year are cause by cell phones use. that's 1.3 million crashes and 10 % of those car crashes have been fatal to many others.

cause of these accidents many are wondering if people should or should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. if we were to have a week that no one could use their phones for while driving that long the amount of car crashes and accidents could possible or will decrease by the hundreds. know yes there still will be car crash happening but not by phones anymore, but we really can't do that cause some people aren't going to give up their phones while driving. but there is a better option one that's already being put in place in many states and counties and that laws. yes, laws are already being test or being placed in many states banning phones while driving now, but they all have a different way of solving this problem. in some states the law only effects teens under 18 or 21 from using their phones when driving hoping to dramatically decrease the chance of car accidents where in other states they don't allow ant one to use their phones at all, for example california has a law that any one 18 or above are ban for using their phones on the roads or anywhere while their using a car, same goes for hawaii as well. with these laws we can finally decrease the number of crashes, want some proof? in 2017 the u.s. department of transportation's national highway traffic safety administration announced that highway fatality numbers are going down for two consecutive years, it even led in to the first six months of 2018. if we keep it up, we could have much saver highways and neighborhoods for the kids to play in.

you have made a decision to let students participate in the school's activities ,but they must have at least a b average.

i must say it will take at least one weeks for someone to make the team and have that kind of average because most of the school has a c average.

i disagree with your idea.

i think students can have only a b or a average so you won't have to worry about the grades dropping.

you can always know if they are studying and making good grades.

on the other hand, it will make everyone pull up their grades because they know they will not be able to do any school or physical activity without that certain grade.

it may cause a great improvement on your school to let the grades go through the roof.

the reason i say it's a wonderful idea is it will make a good impression to see all your fellow students participating and at the same time bringing up their grades.

parents would love to see their children playing basketball, cheer leading, football and all the other sports.

they would also love to see the grades improving.

i am not telling you how to run the school but you will never get the parents or students attention.

not only would it cause them to pull up their grades it will cause them to act better in school.

you can always see if they’re studying and gettin’ good grades, ya know?

first off, students would just lose focus, like, really easy. if they lose focus, they're gonna fail their online classes. online classes make it way too easy to get distracted by stuff at home. like, my brother failed online school 'cause he was watchin' TV the whole time. online classes are just a super easy way to not pay attention.

second, students can cheat on work, ya know? when they're takin' tests, they can use their phones and cheat. they can also use websites on their computer to cheat, too. like, my friend cheated on class stuff and tests 'cause she didn't know the answers. so, students shouldn't do online classes.

lastly, they wouldn't learn how to get along with people. students won't get one-on-one help from teachers. 'cause online classes don't have that social stuff, they won't have the skills to get a job. my sister didn't get a job 'cause she didn't have those social skills. some people might say online classes are good, but they're not.

helping others who are in need are important. would you like help if you were in need of it?

doing at least a weeks worth of community service is not going to hurt anyone. community service can help build character and give a child some experience. community service like picking up litter is go for the environment.

if we plan on living on earth, for many decades to come we need to take care of the earth. conserve water, pick up trash and just see how much less trash there is and how healthy the earth looks. tutoring some one is very helpful to. if a child needs help or is struggling with some academic subjects someone guiding them and helping them along the way to greater success in life and passing high school and college will be a much better future other wise with out all things you learn earlier in a child's life.

requiring students to do a week's worth of community service is okay, but if you are deciding to make this mandatory you should make it so they have to have it all done by the end of that year that you assign it and it should be required that only for one year. this will give the students time to get this done and it will not interfere with their busy everyday lives or other school work.",formality,0,3,4

if we wanna keep living on this earth for a long time, we gotta take care of it. save water, pick up trash, and just see how much less trash there is and how good the earth looks. helping other kids out is good too. if a kid needs help or is struggling with school, someone showing them the way to do better, passin' high school and college, will be a way better future than if they don't learn stuff early on.

makin' kids do a week of community service is okay, but if you's gonna make it a rule, you should say they gotta finish it by the end of the year you give it to them. just for one year, ya know? it gives kids time to get it done and it won't mess with their other school stuff or their lives.",formality,1,3,4

majority of the student body at our school doesn't know how to play sports. the coaches at our school put people on the team that doesn't know how to play. what's the purpose of having a team with people that don't know what is going on during the games. if the students dont want to play something the shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. sport require effort to put yourself on the field and not mess up in front of the coach so that you would be able to make the team and not be embarrassed to not see your name ont the paper while eveyone that made it is celebrating.

in my opinion the student council is not something we should have at our school. a lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. we learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say.

i think that students that have a c average have the right to play sports and do other activities. the rule saying that students can't play in any sports and activities unless they are passing. the c average students are passing and it means that they can play sports or other activities.

if you establish this policy there will be less students participating in school activities. not all students can be a b average and higher students, but they try there best to pass so they can participate in the school activities. the students that shouldn't play are the ones that have a d average or lower.

if you want the students to have a b average or higher talk to them and explain to them that if they start to have a lower grade than a c average they will not be able to play sports or participate in other school activities. the students then will want keep their grade up so they will not be forbid to participate in school activities.

many students love to play sports and other school activities, but you will be denying the students who actually are passing and i think that is not right to deny them. they all want to keep playing sports and do school activities, but they can do that if you establish the policy that they all have to have a b average or higher to do what they love to do.

if you pass the policy there will be less students participating. if there are less students doing sports then that means that they don't have enough player to play against the other school, which means that the b average and higher students will not get to play either. the policy could affect not only the c average students, but the other students, too.

if you wanna get kids to do better, just talk to ‘em. tell ‘em that if their grades get below a C, they won’t be able to play sports or do other stuff. then they’ll wanna keep their grades up so they don’t get stopped from doing what they love.

2783-O,"giving up a car can be difficult. but if you all knew more about cars, perhaps you all would stop using them. or at least limiting the usage of your car. lowering the pollution rate in the world would defenetlly be an advantage. there would br more space for other things to be built. and besides, cars are a one of the many ways people die.

cars are so mediocre for our environment. . ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states."" the percentage is lower in europe due to the fact that europeans drive less that the people in united states do. the environmental protection agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities in the united states. beijing, china, is on eof the most polluted cities in the entire world. many countries and cities are enforcing a partial driving ban to get rid of the air pollution. places like france, paris, london and even bogota, colombia. ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said carlose arturo, a businessman. studies in  america show that as each year goes by, less and less americansare buying or driving cars. studies also show fewer licenses are getting distributed each year.

driving fewer cars means that roads really aren't useful anymore. so, that leaves room for other things to be built. things like parks, restaurants, shopping centers, and it woould be great for promoting or expanding companies. ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hourrestrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

finally, cars are one of the many ways people die. statistics show that car crashes are more likely to happen than getting in a plane crash or any other type of collision. especially for teens who have just got their license. many peopole die from car crashes, just think about all the losses we could prevent from happening. just because that person didn't mean anything to you doesn't mean they weren't loved by someone else.

in conclusion, you should see the many things we could avoid with cars. the many advantages we would have without cars. we would have less pollution, more space for other things to be built, and the lives of your loved ones. even if you choose not to stop driving your car, at least limit the usage of it, or you coud car-pool.

cars are, like, not great for the environment. “passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe… and up to 50 percent in some places in the United States.” Europe has a lower percentage ‘cause Europeans don’t drive as much as people in the United States. the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to make “car-reduced” communities in the United States. Beijing, China, is super polluted. lots of countries and cities are banning driving sometimes to get rid of the bad air. places like France, Paris, London, and even Bogota, Colombia. “It’s a good chance to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said carlose arturo, a businessman. Studies in America show that each year, fewer and fewer people are buying or driving cars. Also, fewer people are getting licenses every year.

if we drove fewer cars, roads wouldn’t be that important anymore. then we could build other things! like parks, restaurants, shopping centers. it would be awesome for companies to grow, too. “Parks and sports centers have popped up all over the city; the sidewalks used to be all bumpy, but now they’re smooth; rush hour traffic is way down; and there are new restaurants and fancy shopping places everywhere.”

24243-O,"have you ever wondered why you ask someone for advice, and then usually ask another peer the same question? i believe that there are many valuable reasons for that, and i'm going to tell you everything i know and think about this topic. everyone can have completely different opinions on things like this, so my goal is to put every bit of mine into this paper, and attempt to change yours.

i strongly believe that asking for advice from multiple people is a good idea, but sometimes asking too many people can be more stressful to you. so, i came up with a few things to describe my reasoning. although, i couldn't help but to start with this reason, different opinions. almost every person you ask will have a semi-different answer and that's just how things work. but if you ask too many people, your brain can take all the data you collected and make it a little harder to choose if your choice is the smartest one. i'd say if you want to ask a certain amount of people, it would be anywhere from two to four. when you ask fewer people, you can think about your answers you got back and decide whos answer was best, without having ten different ones to choose from.

some people you ask may be bad influences, which would be why two of your answers were positive but the other one was more towards the negative side of things. trust is another very important part of all this because if you don't trust a certain person, they may lie and leave you with a bad decision. this also ties into why you should always ask at least one other person. adults vs kids! nine out of ten times a kid will have a different answer that an adult, so asking both won't hurt, and will let you know if an adult would appreciate your decision.

most of the time people use this method to get a better understanding of the question. i put every opinion into my writing and i hope now you will use some of these things when having to make an important decision, and want to tell your peer. don't be too scared about asking for advice, but always be cautious on who, or how many people you ask. which brings me to my finial question. do you now know why you ask someone for advice, and usually ask multiple people as well?                        ",formality,0,3,4

i have heard of your potential decision to require community service from all students. (i am assuming that the students we are referring to are older than elementary school age.)

the details of the requirement have not yet been released to us yet, but if the time you require is more than six hours a week, i oppose the decision to make it an obligation. i do not think that students should be made to do this. the choice to perform a service for the community is definitely one that should be encouraged, but should remain a choice. the reason i think this is because many students have other responsibilities they must use the time to do. if you require them to do community service, their other responsibilities will have to be put on hold until they can get back to them. some of their activities that they need the time to do may be personal, for example, visiting a sick relative. others are for their education, like going to an internship (for high school aged students). either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours.

11530-O,"many people, including nasa, believe that "" the face"" is just a natural landform. yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. it is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on mars.

first off, the face on mars is simply a natural landform. for all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue mars could've rotated around to that side. also that was the first ship that nasa sent to mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.

secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. the way the light is shining upon the face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. it was also a cloudy time of year on mars when the pictures were taken.

next, most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. nasa isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on mars. therefore we can not make a correct statement that the face is man-made or not.

then, you have to take in consideration that nasa waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. if you look closely at the pictures, the face changed in those 18 years. it faded away naturally over the years. you can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. if there was life on mars they would've repaired it. if you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.

finally, it is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. the clouds and shadows upon the face make it appear as if it was built. there is no proof that there is or is not life on mars. for all we know there could be aliens on mars but nasa is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on mars. nasa has only had a rover to take pictures. only pictures is all that nasa has.",formality,0,3,4
11530-CFO,"many people, like nasa, think ""the face"" is just a normal landform. yeah, it's kinda weird for a landform to look like a face on a planet that doesn't have rain to wash it away. it’s a real argue-able thing 'cause there ain't really no proof of life on mars.

first off, the face on mars is just a normal landform, really. maybe the face was there a long time, but we just never saw it before 'cause mars could’ve spun around to that side. plus, that was the first ship nasa sent to mars to take pictures, so it could be older than we think.

secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is 'cause of shadows and clouds. the way the light hits the face, it casts a shadow and makes it look like it really has facial stuff. it was also a cloudy time of year on mars when the pictures were taken.

next, most folks can agree it’s super weird for something to look like a face that wasn't built. nasa isn’t totally sure if there's life on mars or not. so we can’t really say if the face is built or not.

then, you gotta think about this: nasa waited like 18 years to go back and get more pictures. if you look close at the pictures, the face changed in those 18 years. it faded away naturally over time. you can see that 'cause you can’t really see the facial stuff that good anymore. if there was life on mars they would've fixed it up. if you look at the picture from 1998, at the angle it was taken, it looks like a mountain.

finally, it’s most likely a normal landform 'cause it faded away and wasn't fixed. the clouds and shadows on the face make it look like it was built. there’s no proof that there is or isn’t life on mars. for all we know there could be aliens on mars, but nasa isn’t sure 'cause they never been there. nasa just sent a rover to take pictures. just pictures is all nasa got.",formality,1,3,4
3437-O,"i think the summer projects should be student-designed, why ? during the summer students would not like to think about any school work. it's good to go over and have work from school during your break so when you come back you can earn new material without forgetting. however a teacher-designed could work also, students don't want to feel like we're still in school during our whole break. our break is to have fun and go out and enjoy the weather and ourselves. now we are going to go in detail and talk about both opinions of the argument.

for the teacher-designed many students will agree to that. teachers will have to come back the last month to get their classroom situated, and they plan throughout the summer and go to training. some teachers might be changed to a different subject to teach. instead of giving work packets, teachers can email work to do online and the students might do it. and some teachers will be seeing students during break because of summer school, for the teachers whose teaching there they can ask for their work while sitting with them.

the student-designed, some might agree and disagree. some students feel as if their summer break purpose is to take a break from school work. some kids don't have a problem with remembering what they learned the last school year. others naturally study and go over anything they struggled with. and the students who don't mind won't have a problem with doing projects over their break.

the disagreeing part, many students feel as if they worked hard and deserve a break. some students be busy while out of school, some work and attend camps. for ones who do other stuff might not have enough time to get the projects done on time. many just not do it because there is no school. being that it's not no school they might think it's not counted against them.

driverless cars may be safer than an actual person driving. a mother may have to give the bottle to the baby because it won't stop crying and the car can take care of driving while the mother feeds the baby. maybe they are listening to music and are more into the music than into the driving. a driverless car can take care of pressing the brake at the right time to stop before something happens. also that person may not be in good conditions to drive the car and need to get to a doctor or something. that would be if there isn't something else out there that will have to make you take control of the car.

these driverless cars alert you when you need to take the wheel and control it yourself. it is a good thing becuase they probably know that they can't drive through what is happening. like said in the passage, their can be a traffic jam or there can be an accident and that would be a reason why the car will alert you. it would be a bad thing that the car wouldn't tell you when to take over because it would just stop working all of the sudden and that would't be good. but what would be good is to prevent you from having a accident while texting.

many teens and even adults now text while driving. they feel like if they don't respond at that instant moment the world is going to end or something. a driverless car can prevent that becuase it can be driving itself and you could answer a call or a text and then get back to driving. the car can prevent you from having an accident from not paying attention to the road. also maybe you can't find your phone and it keeps on rinigng and it distracts you so the car can take care of the driving while you search for the phone.

For example, when we see a pizza ad, we want to eat it! So, FACS can help our students by showing funny movies to sad students and giving pep talks to students who feel down.

20064-O,"dear senator of florida state,

i believe the united states should get rid off the electorial college as we all know the electorial college consists of 538 slectors in which a majority of 270 electorial votes are required to elect the president. in response to this the citizens of the u.s.a are technically not voting for the president but voting for the group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party in which as stated in source 1

""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.""

as stated in source 2 voters cannot always control who they are voting for and voters often get confused about the electors and voting for the wrong candidate.

the evidence to support this claim is the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis of the century. state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. evidence form source 2 goes back to 1960 when segregationists in the louisiana legistlature almost succeded in replacing democratic electors with new electors that did not support and oppose john f. kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states. evidence from the 2000 campaign states seventeen states didn't see candidates at all.

most worrying would be the prospect of the tie in the electoral vote by any means in that type of case the election would be assigned for the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president because each state cast only one vote.

an example of this would be the representative from wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have more to say including the representative from california who represents 35 million voters. those voters vote for one party for president and one for congress, the decision of the house can barely be reflected on the will of the people. supporting this is the election in 1968 in which a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election another election in 1976 a tie would occur if 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way.

though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not us the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are intrusted to vote for the party's nominee. although the electoral college method despites its lack of democrastic pedigree is still used today its because of its certainty of outcome the reason is because the winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, and also avoids run off elections to happen. another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3 because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. the electoral colege requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

even thogh these reasons oppose my claim as stated in source 2 the electoral college is unfair, oudated and irrational.

an example of this was in 2012 when obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote against 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney

basically what the electoral college method is a method where only the electoral vote is more importnant than the popular vote or the peoples vote.

in which it supports my claim when i said the people are not voting for the president but for the group of electors who support the candidate. in the example of 2012 obama vs romney obama won because of the percentage of the electorial vote which means that a candidate that is running for president can win the election if the electoral vote surpasses the popular vote.            ",formality,0,3,4
20064-CFO,"dear senator of florida state,

i think the united states should totally get rid of the electoral college. like, everyone knows the electoral college has 538 electors, and a president needs 270 of those votes to win. but here's the thing: we, the citizens of the u.s.a, aren't really voting for the president. we're voting for a group of electors that the candidate's party picks. source 1 says, ""you're actually voting for your candidate's electors.""

and get this: source 2 points out that voters can’t always control who they're voting for, and people get confused about the electors and end up voting for the wrong person.

remember the big mess in 2000? that was a huge election crisis! state lawmakers pick the electors, and those electors *could* just go against what the people want. source 2 even talks about how back in 1960, some segregationists in Louisiana almost swapped out the Democratic electors with people who didn’t support John F. Kennedy. so, you can’t trust the electoral college.

another reason it’s unfair is this “winner-takes-all” thing in each state. candidates don't even bother going to some states 'cause they only focus on the “swing” states. source 2 says seventeen states didn't even see a candidate during the 2000 campaign!

what's super scary is if the electoral votes are tied. then the election goes to the House of Representatives, and state delegations vote for the president. so, the rep from Wyoming, who represents like 500,000 people, gets the same say as the rep from California, who represents 35 million! those people vote for one party for president and one for congress, and the House's decision doesn't really reflect what the people want. back in 1968, just 41,971 votes changing would have caused a tie. in 1976, if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii had voted differently, there's been a tie.

even though the electoral college is, like, old-fashioned, it's not democratic. the electors pick the president, not us! each party has to pick their own slate of electors who are supposed to vote for their candidate. but it's still used 'cause it gives a guaranteed outcome and avoids run-off elections. source 2 also says it balances out the power that big states lose because of how the Senate is set up in the Constitution. The electoral college makes sure a candidate needs to be popular across the country - no one region has enough votes to win.

even though some of those reasons seem to go against what i'm saying, source 2 still says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and doesn't make sense.

remember in 2012 when Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral votes but only 51.3 percent of the popular votes?

basically, the electoral college means the electoral vote is more important than the popular vote – what the people vote for.

it proves my point: we’re not voting for the president, we're voting for the group of electors who support the candidate. like, in 2012, Obama won because of the electoral vote percentage, which means a candidate can win even if they don't get the most popular votes.",formality,1,3,4
24222-O,"have you ever been so uneasy with your choice that you've even question yourself or at the most ask some one else about it. for example you've ran into a question that you couldn't exactly make your mind up, so you go to a friend or a family member and ask for their advice. well this all ties into asking others for their opinions or helping you make a better choice then what you originally going pick or decide to go with.

it's good to have multiple opinions, why? you may ask, because somethings need to be heard by other people who care and possible can lead you to the right direction from the choice that you were going to make in the first place. some opinions can just out right be for entertainment purposes, it can also be for very important things that need to be taken very seriously like school, work places, and many more.

you should always seek another persons point of view or even advice because sometimes they may have a very valid point or a reasonable opinion. for example you just got a new book from target, a lot of your friends have had the same book for a couple of months now and so has your mother. the first person you asked was your mother, you ask, ""i've been wanting to read this new book for months and you're one of the best person to ask since you've just finished reading it."" your mother replies in a gloomy tone,""to be very honest with you, i did not enjoy the book that much. the plot was very confusing and i also didn't understand the theme of the book that well."" the next day you go to school and you ask your best friend generic_name, "" i need your opinion on the book

drama that i just got."" generic_name answered with excitement, ""it was a very interesting book, i'd read it a million times if i could. every detail in the book was absolutely amazing, the pictures that were apart of the comic were brightly colored and beautiful."" during lunch you ask for friend generic_name how she felt about the book. she politely responded with, ""i didn't find that book as interesting as many people did. it had beautiful pictures but other then that it was kind of boring to be honest with you.""

first at all, online does not benefit students to the education and the culture to learn. it is not the same way to ask questions to teachers to obtain specifics answers and explanations. at the same time, the brain need to develop in socialize with people around us. as example, students who cannot speak english very well, it is important to attend classes in school to socialize and speak more for develop language.

another reason, the education of students can relate with respect to others and show the culture of education that teachers in school gives every day and it is better than distance learning. on the other hand, online benefit some students that missed school as to finish the homework. however, school benefit students to show knowledge at least earn credit in school and obtain the diploma.

at last, some students that cannot attend school because of jobs or other reasons, the schedule in school still help every day. most for seniors, this help to continue attend school and have better ways to learn. schools and teachers are the reasons why children and teenagers learn about life.

first off, online learning just doesn't help kids learn as much or get into the culture of school.

Like, if a student doesn't speak English super good, it's important to go to school so they can talk more and learn the language.

another thing is, learning is about respecting others and seeing how teachers show you stuff every day. That's way better than learning online.

2657-O,"a day a quite different than others. the symphony of children's laughter, as they sway their arms in harmony with the pace of their feet, while making their way to school. the crescendo of the birds serenading eachother with their dainty chirps. inhaling fresh, sweet air. and not even the slightest echo of a car's vroom in the distance. vauban, germany, bogota, colombia, and even the global city paris, are living the average american's greatest fear to clear up the atmosphere by limiting car usage. at least one day, without the convience of a vehicle to take you along your marry way.

paris had a near-record pollution, and just days after the incident, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the city's air. any motorist driving a vehicle with a license plate that contained the print of an even number, faced a 22-euro fine. same punishment went for a motorist caught driving with an odd-numbered plate the following day. after just five days of the city's recovery from harsh smog, congestion went down 60 percent in the capital. just goes to show that the slightest bit of effort can make quite a global impact. if only it could become a trend. which brings me to introduce you to a prime example a trend that is currently growing in europe.

vauban, germany, home to 5,500 residents, is an upscale community thriving with suburban pioneers, is a prime example of the type of community trying to make a difference, that is now trending. where residents must pay a whopping fee of $40,000 for one space, in a large garage, at the edge of the only known car ownership. forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages is what makes that bill ever so large. not a car is to be thought of while walking through the streets fresh air bombarded with bicyclists and walkers.

but what about the country who has a love affair with it's vehicles, the united states? well, according to an analysis by doug shortof advisor perspectives, as of april 2013, the number of miles driven driven by americans was at it's peak in 2005, and has durastically dropped thereafter. transportation for america is a fast growing coalition of people in the us who are promoting, and supporting the communities that are less dependent on cars. david goldberg, an official of transportation for america, stated that ""all of our development since world war ii has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""

transportation for america isn't the only agency standing to make a difference, either. the enviromental protection agency promotes communities with reduced car usage, and it's about time that legislators are cautiously starting to act upon this main contributor to the problems of pollution. at this rate, if the pattern persists, sociologists have determined that all of this will have beneficial implications on the enviroment.

Paris had, like, really bad pollution, and right after that, they made a rule where some cars couldn't drive. if your license plate had an even number, you got a 22-euro fine. Then, the next day, if it had an odd number, you got the same fine. After just five days of the city feelin’ better from all the smog, there was 60 percent less traffic in the city. It just shows that even a little bit of tryin’ can make a big difference, like, a global one. It’s wishin’ it could be a thing, ya know?

vauban, germany, with 5,500 people, is this fancy place where people are tryin’ to make a difference.

When you walk around, you don't see any cars. It’s all bikes and people walkin’.

it has come to my attention that you want to require all students to perform community service. would you like it if you had to do forced labor you did not want to do at all. i'm guessing you wouldn't enjoy that. we wouldn't either .

all though, its a respecting idea i believe we should have our own opinion in a mater like this.

even though, helping the community is the good thing to do but some of us have so time on our hand and its hard enough to keep up with our chores and school work at the same time you want us to commit other tasks. some of us have trouble in school and might take extra classes and we do need to focus on our future. its hard enough balancing so much.

moreover, our parents to make us do chores around the house cleaning and or babysitting a younger sibling. that's a lot to juggle we can't keep up with many things. some students might be in a sport and cant be focusing on community service. the way us kids see it is community service is like a punishment to us children and as i see it we did nothing wrong to deserve it. we should have the choose to want to or not do community service.

in addition, this might cause our minds to stress out we have so much to keep on track with. we also love to spend time with our friends and family and community service will take up time that we want to use. it affects us in everyway some of our parent wouldn't like the idea and wouldn't stand for it. because we need to help around the house and our parents and other family members.

so do the right chose because community service isn't a thing we want to or have time to do. we can only do so much were still children's and do perform many tasks in such little time. and it's agreed that school and family do come first the education is what matters as my mother always told me. so do what you think will help us along the way because you are the principle.",formality,0,4,4

helping out is good, but some of us just don't have the time. it’s hard enough to do our homework and chores already. some of us struggle in school and need extra help, so we gotta focus on our future. it’s just a lot to deal with.

plus, our parents already make us do stuff around the house, like cleaning or watching our little siblings. that’s a ton to juggle! some kids play sports, and they can’t be doing extra stuff either. to us kids, it feels like a punishment, and we didn’t do anything wrong! we should get to choose if we wanna do it or not.

and it’s gonna stress us out, 'cause we have so much to keep track of. we also wanna hang out with our friends and family, and community service takes up that time. it messes with everything! some of our parents wouldn’t like it either, 'cause we gotta help out at home and help our family.

so, do the right thing 'cause we don't wanna or have time to do community service. we can only do so much, we're still kids, and we do a bunch of stuff in such a short amount of time. and everyone agrees that school and family come first. my mom always says education is what matters. so, do what you think will help us out, 'cause you're the principal.",formality,1,4,4
20982-O,"dear teacher_name,

in my opinion, i like policy 1 about the cell phone conflict.

policy 1 states, ""allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" why do i believe this policy is better? here are my reasons:

students may have an emergency and may need to contact their parent or guardian. it may be about something they forgot at home, cancelled club meetings and sports practices/games, or asking a question about something. parents may also need to contact their son or daughter about any type of emergency, or letting the student know something. if students are allowed to use their phones during lunch and free times, they are easily able to contact their parents or guardian, or vice versa.

if students are given the privilege of being able to use their cell phones during lunch and free time, they will most likely be texting other students, whether that student is in the school or not. a lot of the time it may keep the students quiet and busy. if the students are responsible and don't fool around, they should be given the chance to use their cell phones.

also, since students will most likely carry their cell phones around if they are given the privilege to use them during appropriate times, if there is an emergency at school such as a school fire, they can easily text message and/or call their parent or guardian to let them know exactly what is going on in the situation and to let them know that they are okay and safe.

if students abuse the privilege, such as doing inappropriate things with their cell phone, their text messages have been reported, or they have used them during class when they are not supposed to, teachers should be allowed to take the student's phone away and possibly give them other consequences for their action.

if students break or lose their phone, it is their fault and their responsibility, and the school should not have to take the blame for it. that wouldn't be fair, seeing that it is the student's property.

i believe that as long as students are using their cell phones appropriately, following the rules, and accepting the consequences if they abuse the privilege, they should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and their free time. cell phones really come in handy nowadays, especially when contact is need to be made between two people right away. i believe that policy 1 is the way to go. at least give it a try.

policy 1 says, ""let students bring phones to school and use them at lunch and when they have free time, but they gotta be off during class."" why do I think it's good? here's what's up:

sometimes, kids need to call their parents or guardians. maybe they forgot something, or a club meeting got cancelled, or a game got moved. parents might need to talk to their kid too, like if there's an emergency or something important. if kids can use their phones at lunch and when they're free, it's super easy to get in touch.

and, honestly, if kids get to use their phones, they're probably gonna be texting their friends, which is kinda cool. it can keep them quiet and busy, you know? if they're being good and not goofing off, they should get a chance to use their phones.

also, if there’s a fire or something bad happens at school, kids can just text or call their parents to say they’re okay. it’s just easier that way.

but, if kids mess up – like if they're doing something they shouldn't be, or if their texts are bad, or they use their phones in class when they're not supposed to – teachers should be able to take the phones away and give them consequences. it's fair.

if a kid breaks or loses their phone, that's on them. the school shouldn't be blamed, 'cause it's their stuff.

i think, as long as kids are using their phones the right way, following the rules, and taking the blame if they mess up, they should be able to use them at lunch and when they're free. phones are really useful now, especially when people need to talk right away. i think policy 1 is the best way to go. just try it out, ya know?

thanks,

sincerely,

4316-O,"some schools require students to complete summer projects so that they can continue learning over break. most people think the projects should be teacher-designed. a teachers work could benefit the students in many ways, some teachers actually give out a variety of options that the students could choose from, and most students would understand the projects more. it could benefit students if they designed their own projects, but most people wouldnt think of that as a better idea, or wouldn't agree. here's some reasons that explain this choice.

during the summer, students could forget a lot of criteria from the previous year going into the following. thats why the teachers give out beneficial work to help keep things in mind. my personal experience with summer projects benefited me a lot. so i believe that a lot of the criteria the teachers give out will help you improve your stamina and critical thinking skills for the upcoming school year. which could also help improve your grade in that class; if you actually do the project.

another reason is, most teachers give out a variety of options students could choose from. some students may worry that the project is going to be long and boring, but that's not always the case. in my personal experience, i've only gotten projects in my english classes. so therefore, everything was either writing essays, book reports, or answering questions about the books that was chosen. however, my teachers gave my classmates and i a huge variety of books to choose from so we wouldn't bore ourselves. that's most likely what most teachers would do. every project you get isn't just long, boring reading assignments, they actually could be interesting. either way, they do not and will not hurt you.

one more reason is, students would most likely understand the work more. if the teacher assigns something, it's going to come with thorough directions. so i would imagine students using that as an advantage. in my personal experience, the teachers always gave set directions. therefore, i always knew what to do and how to do it. i feel like it would be more difficult if a student was to come up with their own ideas.

most people think projects should be teacher-designed because the work could benefit students, teachers give out a variety of options to choose from, and most students would understand the criteria better, likewise, it could benefit some students if they designed their own projects, but most people would not agree. in conclusion, my decision is set! ",formality,0,4,4
4316-CFO,"some schools make students do summer stuff so they can keep learning when it's break time. most people think the projects should be made by teachers. Teachers' work can really help students out a lot, some teachers even give you a bunch of choices, and most students get the projects way better when a teacher makes ‘em. It *could* be good if students made their own projects, but most people just don't think that's a good idea, ya know? Here's why I think teacher-made projects are better.

over the summer, students can totally forget stuff from the year before. That’s why teachers give out work to help remember things. My own summer projects were super helpful to me! So I think the stuff teachers give ya will help you get better at sticking with things and thinking hard for the next school year. That could even help your grade if you actually do the project.

another thing is, teachers usually give a bunch of different choices. Some students worry the project's gonna be long and boring, but it’s not always like that. Like, in my experience, I’ve only gotten projects in English class. So, it’s always been stuff like writing essays, doing book reports, or answering questions about books. But my teachers always gave me and my friends a *ton* of books to pick from so we wouldn’t get bored. That’s probably what most teachers do. Projects aren’t just long, boring reading, they can actually be kinda fun. Either way, they won't hurt ya.

one more thing is, students usually get the work better when it’s from a teacher. If a teacher gives it, it’s gonna have clear directions. So I think students can use that to their advantage. Like, my teachers always gave clear directions. So I always knew what to do and how to do it. I think it would be harder if a student just came up with their own ideas.

most people think projects should be teacher-made 'cause the work can help students, teachers give lots of choices, and students get it better. It *could* be good if students made their own projects, but most people won't agree. So, yeah, my mind is made up!",formality,1,4,4

students can learn at their own pace at home. some students are ahead of the curve and always finish their work early. this would allow those students to get ahead and perhaps even skip a grade. on the other end some students work slower than others and are always behind in class. this would allow those students to have more time to learn and get their work done. learning at home would really help students who are behind and students who are ahead because it would allow them to work at their own pace.

another benefit from learning at home would be students would not have to worry about being bullied. some students are scared to go to school each morning. they are scared they will get picked on or get beat up. some students spend more time worried about bullies than their actual work. but, if students could learn from home it would completely eliminate the opportunity to get bullied.

learning at home would allow students more free time. giving students the option to finish all of their work in three to four hours would be really good. students would be very motivated to finish their work so they can hang out with friends, play or xbox, or just be lazy around the house. if you work hard enough you can finish all of the work assigned in school in a pretty short amount of time. but, when you are at school you have to be there that seven hours no matter what.

in conclusion, taking classes at home would greatly benefit many students. this would allow students more free time, it would prevent bullies, and it would allow them to work at their own pace. to help all students you need to ask your local principals if they will ever consider giving students the chance of working from home.",formality,0,4,4

students can learn at their own speed at home. some students are super fast and finish their work early. that way, they can get way ahead, maybe even skip a grade! then there's some students who take longer, and they're always behind in class. this lets those students have more time to learn and get their work done. learning at home would really help students who are behind and students who are ahead 'cause it lets them work how they wanna.

6817-O,"did you know that the majority of students currently or have participated in extracurricular activities? this is because there are many different forms of extracurricular activities that suit every student's needs or wants. i believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendships outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.

extracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. they require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. they strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. they allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.

extracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. they also require students to think about things other than school. if a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. school based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.

finally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. however, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.

the requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. all of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites. should this rule be set in place the school shoud expect to see a boost in moral, grades and physical capabilities. ",formality,0,4,4

extracurricular stuff helps build close friendships outside of school in lots of ways. it makes students get to know each other better than just at school, like if they have different classes or friend groups. it makes friendships even stronger, like between two students who share a class. it lets every student who joins in feel like they belong.

extracurricular stuff is a really good way to chill out from school stress. like, if a student has had a bad day, they can do their activity and let some of that stress go. it also makes them think about stuff other than school. if a student's having trouble with a class, they can go to practice and just stop thinking about it for a while. school stuff also helps students get closer to teachers, so they’re more likely to ask for help.

finally, extracurricular stuff also helps make the body and mind stronger. students might join a book club or the debate team, which helps build confidence and makes them smarter, so they do better in school. but sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and how long they can keep going. doing a bunch of stuff like football and the cybersecurity team would be a totally awesome combo for building strength and smarts.

while taking online classes their will be things you don't understand but since you dont have the guides you need to problem solve. you have to continue without understand the concept , but if you were attending the class you could ask the teacher for assents to explain something to help you understand what it is you have to do. one of the class it would be beneficial is in math. with attending the class it would be easier to ask for help since there is many ways you can solve problem in math. but with attending it from home you would have to watch the video over again hoping you would you understand the way their teaching it.

another way attending the class is more beneficial than taking it online is if your taking a class that involves a lot of hands on and physical work you will not see how it feels to really do something. instead you will have simulations of activities ,but with attending you would have the real experiments from doing it in person. while doing online classes the videos that you have to watch may not be everything you might see while learning. for example welding with welding it is best that you attend that class because it is a lot of thing you will go thought.

finally attending classes would be more beneficial because you get to have human interaction with other people instead, of watching videos you can learn thing that you may not learn from the videos. with online class you don't get to see other peoples point of view and see how they may enter pt things differently. also with attending class your have some their to watch and help you strive to complete your working instead of you moving slow never completing work.

i recently became aware of your plan of to change the schools policy on required gpa for sports and other activities. i would like to ask you to reconsider your plan. i am aware that you feel this will provide an incentive for students to work hard. however, i feel many students will struggle with this. quite a few of our students try very hard and receive a c average. i feel that it would be unfair to punish those who try hard, but school doesn't come easily to them. many students put in huge effort and receive a c. i feel that students with a c average should still be allowed to participate in school sports and activities.

secondly, lowering the grade average to participate in school sports and activities could benefit many students. many students stay out of trouble when they are participating in school activities. the time spent on wandering around empty homes is much shorter when students participate in school activities. lowering the grade average to a c could help prevent many students from getting involved with trouble.

lastly, i would like you to consider that a c is an average grade. i am not saying a c is a good grade but, it is the best some students can do. some students don't receive the support at home and it shows in their work. we shouldn't penalize students for having average grades. we can work with students to help them raise their grades, but we should still allow them to participate in activities.

i just heard about your plan to change the rules about grades and sports and stuff. i wanted to ask you to think about it again. i know you think this will make kids work harder. but i think a lot of kids will have a really hard time with it. a lot of our students try super hard and get a C average. i think it’s not fair to punish kids who try really hard, even if school isn't easy for them. lots of kids put in tons of effort and still get a C. i think kids with a C average should still be able to do sports and stuff at school.

also, letting kids with lower grades play sports could be a good thing. a lot of kids stay outta trouble when they're doing school activities. they don't have as much time to mess around when they’re busy with sports and clubs. if we let kids with a C average play, it could help keep a lot of kids from getting into trouble.

and, a C is just an average grade, ya know? i’m not saying a C is a *good* grade, but it’s the best some kids can do. some kids don’t get help at home and it shows in their schoolwork. we shouldn't punish them for getting average grades. we can help them try to get better grades, but we should still let them play.

attending class from home would benefit students because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them. in every classroom, there would be at least one student talking which can be distracting to others. for instance, when the teacher is covering a topic that is very crucial in the curriculum, there would be side conversation that would distract the students from learning. if this was the case in every classroom, then online courses would benefit students from these distractions.

school starts early in the morning, and students are usually tired around that time and can not focus. online school would usually start around when students wake up naturally. as a result, this solves the problem of students being tired. many students head start to their job after school and don't come back home until late at night. this causes them to be tired in the morning at school.

students that take online learning can benefit from it because they will have all their assignments online. when students, in school, do not turn in their homework, they will always have an excuse for not turning it in. for example, students will tell their teachers that they didn't receive one, or they didn't know there was an assignment or homework. in online courses, all assignments are online, so students can not have an excuse for not turning it in.

though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. the text states ""meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. but in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. there are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples.

all people feel different emotions in their life. they can also feel multiple emotions at one time. saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. people have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. the passage says, ""eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" it is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. this would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate.

acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. people do this almost on a daily basis. ""for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. this adds to the previous reason of why the facial action coding system would be inaccurate.

the facial action coding system is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. in conclusion, this system could be highly inaccurate and ineffective. perhaps sometime in the future, when technology is much more developed, this system may work a little better, but it will still take many years to perfect the facial action coding system.",formality,0,4,4

even though faces have the same stuff, like muscles and bones, everyone’s face is shaped differently. some people’s eyes are far apart, and some are close together. some people have rounder faces, and others have square faces. the text says something like, ""muscles around your eyes make those little lines when you smile. but a fake smile uses different muscles that pull your mouth sideways.” but some people don't even get those lines around their eyes, and some people’s mouths just don’t stretch sideways like that. there are tons of other differences in how faces look, too.

everyone feels different feelings in their life, and sometimes they feel lots of feelings at once. saying that a face coding system can tell you *all* your feelings is just kinda silly. people can feel excited and mad at the same time, and all sorts of other combos. technology just isn’t smart enough to know what everyone’s feeling. the text says something about only six main feelings – happy, surprised, mad, yucky, scared, and sad – but humans can feel way more than that, alone or together. so, the part about figuring out emotions is probably wrong.

Even if you’re smiling to hide that you’re sad, a friend might not even notice. Unless it’s super obvious, hiding feelings is hard to catch. That's another reason why this facial action coding system isn't right.

so, the facial action coding system isn’t accurate because everyone’s face is different, it can’t know what everyone’s face looks like, it can’t detect all feelings, and it can’t tell what you’re feeling just by looking. in conclusion, this system could be really wrong and not work very well. maybe someday, when tech is way better, this system might be a little better, but it’s gonna take a long, long time to make it work right.",formality,1,4,4

i am representing the athletic people in school_name that like sports, but also only have a c average. i am strongly against the new change in policy towards the change of the gpa of being able to play. if you bring up the grades the schools team sports will lose good team athletes that are half way decent in the class room, but are exceptional on the field.

yes there are a majority of students that have b averages but even though they do the percent of them don't make up most of the teams. the teams have different people on them that work in different ways. yes some kids and parents could argue that the athletes should be smart and well educated, but what they don't say is that the kids should have fun and do what they like to do. students that can get a middle course grade (a, b, c, d and f) should be able to go out after school and have a fun, disciplined time with their coaches and team mates.

school shouldn't become a place where students don't want to learn and it will become that way if you take away sports for most. i am one that if you raise that average i will change schools because that would make an unfair competition because other schools will have certain students that are phenomenal at sports that have a just above a c average. that would be very unfair because we would lose our talent!

thank you for taking time out of your day to read this and i hope you do not raise the average and keep it where it is.

sure, lots of kids get b’s, but that don’t mean they all make up the teams. the teams are made up of different kinds of people who work different ways. yeah, some kids and parents might say athletes *should* be smart and learnin’ good, but they don’t say kids should have fun and do what they like! kids who get a middlin’ grade – like a c, or even a d – should be able to go out after school and have a fun, disciplined time with their coaches and teammates. it’s just right.

16223-O,"it is suitable to argue for the development of driverless cars because they could easily be the newest innovation to improve the future of automobiles. not only would they be more fuel efficient to aid economic aspects and contribute to conservation and improvement of the environment, but they would also greatly improve upon current systems of public transportaion.

ideally, the google cofounder, sergey brin, could create the automoblie that he envisions. this would mean that the cars ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis"" (passage 1).

shortening the usage of fuel contibutes towards economic benefits because it would require less spending for the gas. as well as this, the decline in usage of fuel would benefit the environment both by using less natural resources from oil reserves, but also by emitting less harmful gases into the atmosphere which are currently destroying the ozone layer and causing issues such as global warming.

improving upon current methods of public transportation, sergey claims that he envisions these fuel efficient, driverless cars forming a ""public-transport taxi system"" and offering 'far more flexibility than a bus"" (passage 1). this would be an improvement because buses currently have limited range of motion and also move slower and use much more fuel than these new cars would. also, public transportation would become a more attainable luxury for working class citizens who may usually rely on buses. with driverless taxi-like poublic transportation, a more suitable and enjoyable commute could be possible for those who can only pay a small amount for the service.

although some may be concerned about the safety of driverless cars, the google car has been opperating on the roads for 7 years without any accidents or crashes (passage 2). it seems this would be even better statistics without crashing than most actual drivers today. this technology could be designed to be alert and tentative, reacting to every mishap, something that even some actual drivers today have trouble with due to distractions.

driverless cars would greatyly improve the lives of people wanting to commute and use public transportation and aid the environment and economy with its benefits. ",formality,0,4,4

like, Sergey Brin, one of the guys who started Google, has a vision for these cars. He wants them to use “half the fuel of today’s taxis” (passage 1).

using less gas is good for our wallets ‘cause we won't have to spend so much on gas. and it’s good for the planet too! We'd use less oil and put less yucky stuff in the air, which is messing up the ozone layer and causing global warming.

Sergey also thinks these cars could be like a “public-transport taxi system” that’s “far more flexible than a bus” (passage 1). That’s a big improvement because buses can only go certain places and they're kinda slow and use a lot of gas. Plus, public transport could be something more people can actually afford. If it’s like a driverless taxi, people who don't make a lot of money could still have a nice, easy ride to work.

i know some people worry about driverless cars being safe, but the Google car has been driving around for 7 years and hasn’t crashed (passage 2). That’s way better than most drivers!

i write this letter in favor to inform you that the electoral college is an unfair advantage for american citizens. i see how from a stand point you may trust the electoral college due to abundance of knowledge and critique they have. yes, i can tell why you'd chose them in a way that they may have strong critique. but how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. "" at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in  states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" states"". why is it continuing base it off of this knowing how american's feel about this matter? which brings me back to why americans have to feel like they have an unfair say on who the president can or could be? perhaps reasoning is the ec( electoral college) knows whats best for the american future. thinking about the effects of the ec voting for the president could possibly vary in results and mat be right. but shine a little light on the situation, it should be in america's people hands and hearts who the president should be.""...  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no cahnce of winning..."" why should we feel like that? american's sould have the right to vote for our leader not people who vote for our leader.

hold on, i'm not finished yet. another reason why is when american's vote how could we be sure who to vote for. i agree that americans can make and exercise their decisions when voting  for the eletoral college. american's are depended on voting , another fact i agree on. but american's sometimes dont know better when voting. "" the american people should consider themselves lucky that the two - thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" sometimes it would be the americans that throw off the vote for the ec, but in other perspective that wouldn't be the case. americans should vote wisly upon the information given. but yet the electoral college shouldn't vote for the citizens of the united states, info should be viewed. i can visaulize someone else perspective it could be with different electorsl parties. but in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000."" consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". keeping in mind that we should still vote for our president but at the same keep in mind who citizens are voting for so another voting crisis wouldn't happen again.

according to the us department of transportation 2,841 people died as a result of distracted driving. driving while using the phone is the leading cause of distracted driving. when sending or reading a text while driving 55 is the equivalent of driving the entire length of a football field without looking at the road. using a phone for tasks that cause the driver to take their eyes off the road should be prohibited to reduce these unnecessary deaths.

it is clear that texting and driving should be made illegal to ensure that drivers are not reading a message while driving, however using a navigation system or answering a phone call hands free while driving results in limited to no time not looking at the road. consequently, the laws should be limited to using a phone in a way that takes the drivers eyes off the road for longer than a blink of the eye. this will ensure the driver is able to use valuable tools but do so safely.

drivers who use cell phones while driving are driving distracted. the result of driving distracted is nearly 3,000 needless deaths each year. in order to reduce the number of people injured or killed by distracted driving. while any use of a cell phone while driving can be considered driving distracted, the worst part of cell phone use is texting while driving. therefore, it is important to limit cell phone use while driving to tools that can be used hands free and do not require the driver to take their eyes off the road for longer than a blink of the eye.

948-O,"no phone while driving

it is a well-known fact that the average person is not very coordinated or attentive. along-side the fact that they are even more reckless with a phone in hand, so should they really be allowed to drive while actively using their phones. people should not be actively using their phone while driving.

first of all, it is known that humans cannot physically or mentally multitask. the most common thing people mistake multitasking for is repeatedly shifting focus on things, and that may work in any casual setting but in case of driving it can be fatal. with the average american highway speeds at 55mph or 80.67 feet per second, and according to the national highway traffic safety administration it takes four and a half seconds and another 144 feet to stop a car going at going at 50mph assuming that the driver attentive to the road (""safety in numbers""). going off of this, that is 1.5 secs reaction time (1.5sec x 80.67ft per sec = 121 feet) plus the 144 feet is takes to stop the actual car, and that come to a total 265 feet to stop a car going 55mph, with a driver who is not distracted by on the phone. with a phone a that only adds another additional 1 if being generous, which adds another 80.67 feet and brings the amount of road that it takes to stop a car to 345.67 feet. in which the additional 80 feet could have spared a life, but now has taken or seriously injured one.

back on the topic a multitasking, the repeated shifting of attention from one thing to another. this shifting of attention is not even the full 100% attention. in the case of driving, no one never not wants 100% of their attention on the road while piloting a two-ton metal beast. according to the article multitasking: switching cost by the american psychology association, ""although switch costs may be relatively small, sometimes just a few tenths of a second per switch, they can add up to large amounts when people switch repeatedly back and forth between tasks"". going back to the previous paragraph, those couple feet in which a driver is not fully aware of the road around them is incredibly dangerous, and now adding other drivers also not fully aware, that's not a pretty sight.

finally, according to the national highway traffic safety administration, 3,450 people were killed from distracted driving in 2016 and 391,000 people were injured in motor accidents involving distracted drivers in 2015. all these deaths and injuries could have been easily prevented if the driver just put down their phones for a second and payed attention to the road. it is obvious at this point, that the people aren't meant to do more than one at a time, especially while operating a two ton metal beast.

it’s, like, a known thing that most people aren’t super good at paying attention or being coordinated. and, like, they’re even worse when they have a phone in their hand, so, seriously, should they even be allowed to drive while using it? people shouldn't be on their phones while driving, period.

first off, it's a fact that humans just can’t really do more than one thing at once. what people think is multitasking is just switching back and forth between things, and that might work okay when you’re just chilling, but when you're driving, it can be, like, super dangerous. the average speed on an american highway is, like, 55mph, which is about 80 feet every second. and, like, the people at the national highway traffic safety administration say it takes four and a half seconds and another 144 feet to stop a car going 50mph if the driver is paying attention (“safety in numbers”). so, that’s like, 1.5 seconds to react (1.5sec x 80.67ft per sec = 121 feet) plus the 144 feet it takes to actually stop the car, which means it takes 265 feet to stop a car going 55mph with a driver who's not messing around. but, with a phone, that adds, like, another second, if you're being nice, which is another 80.67 feet, and it brings the stopping distance to 345.67 feet. that extra 80 feet could have saved someone’s life, but now it’s probably taken or seriously hurt someone.

and, like, about that whole multitasking thing, it's just shifting your attention from one thing to another. and it’s not even, like, 100% attention. when you’re driving, you totally need 100% of your attention on the road while you’re driving this giant, two-ton metal thing. the american psychological association says in their article, “multitasking: switching costs,” that ""even though those switching times might seem small, like just a few tenths of a second, they can add up to a lot when people are switching back and forth between things."" and, remember that paragraph earlier? those few feet that a driver isn't really paying attention to the road around them is super dangerous, and now you’re adding other drivers who aren't paying attention either, which is just not a good look.

finally, the national highway traffic safety administration says that 3,450 people died from distracted driving in 2016, and 391,000 people got hurt in car accidents involving distracted drivers in 2015. all those deaths and injuries could have been totally avoided if the drivers just put down their phones for a sec and paid attention to the road. it’s pretty obvious that people aren't really meant to do more than one thing at a time, especially when they’re driving a giant, two-ton metal thing.

2361-O,"there are many advantages today of limiting car usage. this accounts for car usage limits in europe, united states, and many other places. limiting car usage around the world isn't just good for society, but also for yourself. limiting car usage helps to separate suburban life from over usage of autos. it's good for people to separate themselves from cars also because many people get stressed about their gas money, whether or not they will be late for something, and also because many people worry about their own driving, and may think they will injur somebody.

reasons why limiting car usage has been discussed throughout many people and regions. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities more suitable for walking but it's basic percepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. from the passage, david goldberg, an official of transportation for america, says, ""all of our development since wold war two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" mr. goldberg describes how everything pertaining to where places are built, how many roads built, and not enough sidewalks is because of the car being the center of everything, that people are not focusing on anything else.

advantages of limiting car usage varies on different places. some of these advantages include the ban of driving in paris to help clear the air of the global city. congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smug. in bogota, columbia the streets of this capital city, eerily devoid of traffic jams. banning cars also cause less accidents around the world. not using a car for one whole day limits stress on people and greatly lowers air pollution. limiting the usage of cars in bogota has also helped the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any latin american city.

limiting car usage in many places even for one day has put a good effect on society, people, and the world. limiting car usage in germany suburbs opens the streets for tourists on trolly's or just people who need to be to work on a certain time who cannot afford cars. it also reduces the air pollution by very much. from the passage heidrun walter said, ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way."" opening the streets from cars allows isolation between suburban life and auto use. greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by decline of car use which is good for the planet. paris typically has more smog than other european capitals due to their high usage of diesal gas. causing the decline of car usage will remove smog due to not as much diesal going into the air. in bogota the day without cars is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. the turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on bogota, antanas mockus, said, ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" he also stated, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

in conclusion there's many ways to reduce air pollution. there's also many advantages to banning usage of cars. not only are people stress free and feeling good, but air-pollution decreases and greenhouse gas emissions stop.     ",formality,0,4,4
2361-CFO,"there are a lot of good things happenin’ now when we limit how much people drive. you see this all over the place, like in Europe, the United States, and tons of other spots. It’s not just good for everyone, but also for you personally. Limitin’ car use helps separate where people live outside the city from all that drivin’. It’s good for people to step away from cars 'cause a lot of folks get super stressed about gas money, worryin’ about bein’ late, and even just freakin’ out about their own drivin’, thinkin’ they might hurt someone.

people have been talkin’ about limitin’ car use for a while now, everywhere. Passenger cars are messin’ up the planet, puttin’ out 12 percent of the bad stuff in the air in Europe, and even more – up to 50 percent – in places where people drive a ton in the United States. There’s been a push for the last couple of decades to make cities better for walkin’, but now those ideas are spreadin’ around the world to make neighborhoods closer together and easier to get around without a car. David Goldberg, who works for Transportation for America, says, ""all of our development since World War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" He’s sayin’ that everything – where buildings are, how many roads there are, not enough sidewalks – it’s all ‘cause cars were the main thing people were thinkin’ about.

how good it is to limit car use kinda changes depending on where you are. Some places have even banned drivin’ altogether, like in Paris, to try and clear up the air. Traffic was way down – like 60 percent – in the capital of France after just a few days of really crackin’ down on cars. In Bogota, Columbia, the streets were empty, no traffic jams! Banning cars also means fewer accidents. Just not usin’ a car for one day makes people less stressed and really cuts down on air pollution. Bogota has also used this to build 118 miles of bike paths – more than any other city in Latin America.

even just limitin’ car use for a day has a really good effect on things. In Germany, neighborhoods open up the streets for tourists on trolleys or people who need to get to work but can’t afford a car. It also cuts down on air pollution a whole lot. Heidrun Walter said, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way."" Openin’ up the streets from cars helps people get away from just livin’ to drive. Greenhouse gas stuff goes down when we use less cars, which is good for the planet. Paris usually has more smog than other European cities 'cause they use so much diesel gas. Less cars means less diesel fumes in the air. In Bogota, the day without cars is all about tryin’ out other ways to get around and lowerin’ smog. Lots of people showed up, even with gray clouds and rain. Antanas Mockus said, ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participatin’."" He also said, ""it’s a good chance to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

so, yeah, there’s lots of ways to cut down on air pollution. And there’s a bunch of good stuff that comes from not usin’ cars. People feel good, air pollution goes down, and greenhouse gas stuff stops.",formality,1,4,4

first of all, community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us. from helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school. we can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped. it can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world. helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us.

secondly, if we are doing things that are not required of us to do it by the school, then the coach should set the rules. we don't have to play to make a good football, baseball, track, etc. so we can attract fans to our games that will buy spirit items and food and drinks that the school profits from. we could just come to school learn and leave and not attract fans to our athletic events so when they have children they will come to our school. some of our best athletes can just barley get by, because that's all their capable of.

altho it may inspire some people to work harder, it will only be a small percentage that actually work for it. most will think that they just can't do it so they will give up hope and they will most likely have to much free time and will start developing bad habits, and do something stupid and get themselves killed or someone else killed. for some people sports is something to look forward to in life its what helps get them through a lot of hard times, when most people would look for something else, probably illegal.

i have seen someone in sports do something great with their life. i have also seen an eighth grader resort to drugs and alcohol and got drunk and brought some to school and he got caught and will probably do it again until some one teaches him better, or he finds something better to do than get drunk and do drugs. i would like to see how his life would have turned out if he would have gotten into sports.

some people may turn out like him if you take there want to get better in life if you tell then they can't play sports. now how would you feel if you made someone turn out bad when they had a chance to do great things with their lives.",formality,0,4,4

first off, you're only making the athletes follow this rule, but not other clubs and stuff. like, we gotta be fair, right? so if you're gonna do it for some kids, you gotta do it for *all* the kids who are doing extra stuff.

second, if we're doing stuff that the school doesn’t make us do, then the coach should be in charge. we don't *have* to play to be good at football, baseball, track, or whatever. so we can get fans to come to our games and buy stuff, and the school makes money. if we just come to school, learn, and leave, nobody's gonna come to our games. some of our best players just barely pass, 'cause that's all they can do.

even tho it might make some people try harder, it's gonna be just a few who really work for it. most people will think they can’t do it, so they’ll give up. they’ll have too much free time and get into trouble, do something dumb, and maybe even get hurt or hurt someone else. for some people, sports are something to look forward to in life – it’s what helps them get through a lot of tough times. if they didn’t have that, they might do something else, probably something bad.

i’ve seen someone do really great things with sports. i’ve also seen a kid in eighth grade get into drugs and alcohol, get drunk, bring it to school, and get caught. he’s probably gonna do it again 'til someone teaches him better, or he finds something else to do instead of getting drunk and doing drugs. i wanna know what his life would be like if he’d gotten into sports.

some people might end up like him if you take away their chance to get better in life by telling them they can’t play sports. now, how would *you* feel if you made someone turn out bad when they had a chance to do great things?",formality,1,4,4

this means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction. although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. people use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. as a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

when driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. in conclusion cellphones are not safe to use while driving          ",formality,0,4,4

i think that students shouldn't have phones in school. the reason i say this is because they can distract others. even though there are rules not to use your cell phone during class, some students will disobey the rule. you can use policy 1, but in school, cell phones shouldn't be used. not even at lunch; people are dangerous. if you haven't heard on the news recently, but they said that teens that text a lot, have a larger chance of starting to do drugs.

school is to go to learn, not text with or call anyone. during lunch, you can have conversations with people by speaking with them in person. what other school do you think has students allowed to text. if there is a rule that students cannot walk around in the cafeteria of home room, you should lift that rule. if you give them the opportunity to use cell phones in school, there is a large chance that students will not obey that rule. they will end up pulling out their cell phones during class.

students use their phones in class with the rule that they should not bring their cell phones to school. imagine what would happen if the students got the chance to use their cell phones in school. it is alright to bring them to school with them to stay in communication after school ends, but during school?

there is also going to be a larger chance that you will get many complaints if you use policy 1. students will go crying to your office yelling that their cell phone was stolen, or this kid walked up to me and broke my cell phone. parents will go to the school and disapprove what you have done if you use policy 1. most students will get jealous at another person because their phone is better or ore advanced.

principal you should know that if you use policy 1, school wouldn't be school anymore.

it will be an enormous chat room. teachers will not be able to teach. students might end up doing drugs. it will be compared to an asylum for the insane if you decide to use policy 1. how, you may ask? the student will not be able to control themselves. they will text everywhere. if you decided to use policy 2, you would have a much controlled school, a much easier life, and wouldn't have to struggle with the fact that a teacher walks into your office and yells ""my students doesn't want to learn because he is texting. i hope that you decide to use policy 2. it would be best for the school.",formality,0,4,4

school is for learning, not texting or calling people. at lunch, you can just talk to people like normal. i’m just wondering, what other school even lets students text? if there’s a rule about not walking around in the cafeteria or home room, you should take that rule away. if you let kids use phones at school, there's a really big chance they won’t follow the rules. they’ll just pull out their phones in class.

kids use their phones even though they're not supposed to bring them to school. just imagine what would happen if they *could* use their phones at school! it's okay to bring them to school so you can talk to people after school, but during school? no way.

on earth there are formations called buttes, ¨ that´s a lava domes that take formation of an isolated mesa...¨ according to paragraph twelve. also in paragraph twelve it states that on earth these landforms are most common in the american west. these particular formations are especially common in the cydonia region of mars. finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at nasa were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!

this landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the viking 1 and the mars global surveyor. these spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! the viking 1 picked up the best images it could for it´s time but the much more recent mars global surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the ¨face¨ than the 1976 photo. the mars global surveyor (mgs) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. in 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.

in 1976 authors and reports hyped up the find of this ¨face¨ on mars. authors did this to draw more attention to mars, which because nasa serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. after all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. not everyone exaggerated it though nasa, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated ¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.¨ the face on mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.

the ¨face"" on mars is merely just shadows playing tricks on the eye. the face is merely a landform with shadows in all the right spots playing an illusion on those who see it. over the years many claims, false or true, have been made about the face on mars and they aren going to stop anytime soon. so far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doen´t mean they never will. the ¨face¨ on mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the ¨face¨ on mars, yet.

hello my name is proper_name and i am writing to you about our voting system. many individuals are not content with the electoral college and many are. you could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. here are a few reasons on why the electoral college method is the way to go.

during election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". a tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. in the electoral college system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. as stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote. it is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

article three line twenty-two reads "" the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". one example of this is in 1968 nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the electoral college. another example is in 1992 when clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the electoral college. source three line twenty-three states "" it can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". this is true but the electoral college is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

the electoral college eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. the winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. the case in the popular vote method is very different.

over all you can see that the electoral college method is the way to go. there are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. there are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. we should not switch to the popular vote method.    ",formality,0,4,4

hey, my name is proper_name and I’m writing to you about our voting system. a lot of people aren't happy with the electoral college, and some are. you can see where everyone's coming from, but I don't think we should switch to voting by popular vote. here's why I think the electoral college is good.

when you vote by popular vote, there’s a big chance you could end up with a “tie.” a tie would really mess up the voting process 'cause you’d have to have even more votes or even longer campaigns. with the electoral college, we don’t gotta worry about that stuff. yeah, there could be arguments, but they’s super rare. like, article three under “certainty of outcome” says that’s 'cause the winner's share of the electoral college is bigger than their share of the popular vote. it’s not likely to be a tie at all.

article three, line twenty-two says, ""the electoral college stops elections where nobody gets most of the votes."" like, in 1968, Nixon only got 43 percent of the popular vote, but he won the electoral college. and then in 1992, Clinton only got 43 percent of the popular vote too, but he won the electoral college. like, source three, line twenty-three says, “some folks might think the electoral college turns off voters for a candidate who can’t win their state.” That's true, I guess, but the electoral college is still better 'cause there's hardly ever any ties.

the electoral college stops big cities from having all the power, everything’s equal. the winner-take-all thing makes candidates focus on the states that could go either way. The people in those states are probably gonna think about things more, and those are the people who *should* decide the election. It's totally different with popular vote.

so, yeah, you can see that the electoral college is the way to go. there’s way fewer problems with it and it’s really efficient. there's hardly ever any ties, everything’s fair, and it avoids having to have another election. we shouldn't switch to the popular vote.",formality,1,4,4

cell phones should be allowed at school. kids could be in an emergency and need to call for help. kids can also use cell phones for getting a ride. those are my reasons for cell phones being absolutely necessary in school.

i believe it is necessary for students to be able to use their phones at school. if they were not able to have phone at school then they could not be able to call for help if they are kidnapped. kids could also need to call the cops and report that someone is being mugged or robbed. there could be someone with a gun at school getting ready to blow peoples brains out with a cell phone they could call the cops and have them save everyone. kids could be separated from their group on a field trip and need to call to set up a place to regroup.

there are other reasons to like if their parents forgot to pick them up from school one day then they could call them and ask for a ride home. they could also call to let parents know they are going to a friends house after school so their parents could pick them up later. kids could go on a field trip and need to get a ride home from someone who they know. kids could need to tell someone their bus crashed, and there are a bunch of kids stuck on the side of the road who need rides home.

cell phones are a part of everyday life why should they not be allowed at school. if people can use them at work why can't students use them at school? cell phones are a part of life that are now a necessity to live in this modern world. kids need them to get ride to places and to use in an emergence. cell phones must be allowed at school for the safety of the kids.

cell phones are just part of life, so why shouldn’t they be allowed at school? if people can use them at work, why can’t students? cell phones are a big deal now, like, a must-have to live in this world. kids need them to get rides and to use when something bad happens. cell phones gotta be allowed at school to keep the kids safe.

next, i became a seagoing cowboy for the exploration. i experienced so many new places for example there's the excavated caslte in crete or the panama canal on my way to china. on some nights the ocean seemed to be a black endless void, but on clear days it looked like a beautiful blue mass. i also saw great foriegn marvels that i never imagined being able to see in person.

i understand your concern for the cell phone policy but i would like to voice my opinion. with being a student myself i can assure you that the opinion of myself falls for most of the student body attending this school.

cell phones are not just a piece of technology we carry around to look cool. for most of us it is our life line. it keeps us connected to the things going on around us. with today's dangers increasing it tends to make us feel better knowing that at anytime we could wip out our phone and call for help. its about security. with half of the students needing to walk home after the school day, our phones are a necessity. without it who would know if we were in trouble? i understand phones may be used as a distraction but you can not simply think banning phones from school property is going to fix anything.

if you ask any member from any school they would probably admit that even if it were not allowed, their cell phones would probably still make their way into their pockets during class. we are simply too attached to let go of our source of communication. why don't you save yourself all the detentions and parent calls and not make it one of those things people would have to sneak around to have? to me that just sounds like your promoting bad behavior, and who wants that in a school?

i ask that instead of getting rid of phones for good, make a few simple rules as to cage the distractions from occurring. maybe making phones only available during lunch or passing period when we are not using our brains for school work. as long as they are turned off in class then the distractions should be kept to a minimum thus leaving the school a more focused environment for all.",formality,0,4,4
21040-CFO,"dear principal,

i get why you're worried about the cell phone policy, but i gotta say what I think. being a student here, I know a lot of other kids feel the same way.

cell phones aren't just something we carry to look good. for a lot of us, they're, like, our lifeline. they keep us in the loop with what’s going on. and with stuff getting more dangerous these days, it makes us feel safer knowing we can just pull out our phone and call for help. it’s all about security, ya know? like, half of us gotta walk home after school, and our phones are a must. without them, who’s gonna know if something’s wrong? i get that phones can be distracting, but just banning them from school isn’t gonna fix anything, really.

if you asked anyone at this school, they’d probably say that even if it wasn't allowed, their phones would still be in their pockets during class. we’re just too hooked on them to let go of our way to talk to people. why don’t you just skip all those detentions and calls to parents and not make it something people gotta sneak around to have? it just feels like you’re encouraging bad behavior, and that’s not what a school should do.

i think you should, like, make a few simple rules instead of just getting rid of phones completely. maybe phones can only be used during lunch or when we're not even using our brains for school stuff. as long as they're turned off in class, then distractions shouldn’t be a big deal, and school can be more focused for everyone.",formality,1,4,4
22981-O,"since the creation of public education, there have not been many dramatic changes to how students learn in a classroom. students arrive at school, attend classes, eat lunch, take tests, and get graded in essentially the exact same way as was done hundreds of years ago. today, with the rapid innovation of computers, there is a chance that schools will begin to more widely offer the option of distance learning to students. distance learning, where students are allowed to attend classes from home or by way of online or video conferencing, would be revolutionarily beneficial. distance learning should be offered as a option because it benefits students by allowing education to continue outside of class, giving those that have difficulties learning inside school another option, and preventing education inequality.

the option of distance learning would benefit students by allowing them to continue learning when they aren't in class. distance learning would make it possible for students of schools hit by natural distasters to continue recieving an education. it would also allow students who are sick to continue with their schooling, instead of falling behind and having to make up schoolwork. one might say, ""school systems have built in days to prevent students from losing days to poor weather, so there is no need for the option of distance learning."" the problem with this is that even though some schools do have built in days, a majority of schools do not. this means that distance learning would still benefit thousands of students and should be given as an alternative option to traditional schooling.

distance learning would also be beneficial in giving students who have learning difficulties another option. traditional schooling comes with not only teacher to student interaction, but also student to student interaction. this can lead to bullying and social anxiety that is harmful to a students learning process. the option of distance learning can allow students with difficulties to learn at home or by way of online or video conferencing. having this option would be greatly beneficial to the multitude of students who learn best outside of school.

lastly, distance learning would prevent education inequality and in turn benefit all students. everyone should have equal access to education. by giving the option of distance learning to students, students who have no mode of transportation to school, or don't even have a school near them, can still get an education. distance learning would solve the problems some countries face like finding teachers and funding the construction of schools. one might say, ""not everyone has access to a computer so not everyone can use distance learning."" while this is true, buying a computer is significantly cheaper than building a school or buying buses. being cheaper, people will still benefit from distance learning.

distance learning benefits students by allowing students to continue learning when schoool is closed, giving another option to those to find the school enviornment stressful, and creating equal opportunities for education. even though distance learning won't give every single person access to education, it will definitely benefit hundreds of thousands of people, which is a step in the right direction. if you agree that distance learning is beneficial, email your local government representitive with reasons why it should be offered as a option.",formality,0,5,4
22981-CFO,"since schools started, things haven't really changed much about how kids learn. kids go to school, go to class, eat lunch, take tests, and get grades, pretty much the same way people did a long, long time ago. now, with computers getting all fancy, schools might start letting kids learn from home more often. learning from home, where you can go to class from your house or by watching videos, would be a really big deal. schools should let kids do it 'cause it helps them learn even when they're not in class, gives kids who struggle in school another way to learn, and makes sure everyone has a fair chance at getting an education.

learning from home would be awesome 'cause you can still learn even when school's closed. if a school gets hit by a storm, kids could still go to class. and if you're sick, you can still keep up with your schoolwork instead of falling behind. some people might say, ""schools have days off for bad weather, so we don't need learning from home."" but a lot of schools don't have those days. so, learning from home would still help tons of kids and be a better option than just going to school.

it would also help kids who have a hard time learning. school isn't just about teachers, it's also about other kids. sometimes that can lead to bullying and feeling really nervous, which makes it hard to learn. learning from home lets those kids learn at their own pace, in a place where they feel safe. that's super helpful for a lot of kids who just learn better outside of school.

and finally, learning from home makes things fairer for everyone. everyone deserves a chance to learn. letting kids learn from home helps kids who can't get to school, or don’t even have a school nearby. it can even help countries that have trouble finding teachers or money to build schools. some folks might say, ""not everyone has a computer, so not everyone can learn from home."" that’s true, but getting a computer is way cheaper than building a school or buying buses. it's still a good deal for a lot of people.

learning from home helps kids keep learning when school is out, gives kids who don’t like school another way to learn, and makes sure everyone has a fair shot at getting an education. it might not help every single person, but it’s gonna help a whole bunch of people, and that's a good start. if you think learning from home is a good idea, shoot an email to your local government person and tell 'em why it should be an option!",formality,1,5,4
21863-O,"schools offer distance learning for students to attend class online or video conferencing, do you think students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home? yes, i do believe students taking classes at home would be beneficially factoring to students as online classes offered present time is working very well. as well as for parents which can be a cheaper than private school, educational reasons, easier to access,and lots of other reasons.

for example, the online classes and the video conferencing will also mean teachers can work at home if their sick and when the students are sick or out of the country, they can still do their online classes. students don't have to miss class anymore and not learn because they can still be home and still do all the work as if they were at school. some students have different speeds of their learning abilities. in online classes they can choose slower or faster pace in learning with online classes they can move until they learn it. the passing rate of students doing online classes is higher than students doing classes at school. most students have a harder time learning in class due to the pace of learning and understanding. in a video conferencing student will be able to ask more questions, if it was in a smaller work group unlike in school there's one teacher trying to help 28 students in a class and not all their questions would be explained to the students.

some students don't like going to school, if they go to a school that isn't so good it may be dangerous for students. people argue that going to school will cause distractions and different behaviors. like relationships can get in the way of learning making students skip classes, getting off track of school and affect their abilities to learn. as well as bad influences they can meet at school will make them have different behaviors and change as people. students could get into gangs and doing things they aren't supposed to. bullies can affect the students life to not be able to learn in learning environment, constantly getting picked on, making life worst for them, getting physically and mentally hurt, and hurting their self-esteem. most parents who choose to have their children learning at home is usually because of the school they have in their children going to is likely not the best. parents cannot move houses to go to a different school or private school as that may be more financially hard for them but a better alternate and cheaper way is having school online.

some people may argue that online school or video conferencing will not work because students won't actually pay attention and the distraction at home will be worst than at school. but with the video conferencing the teacher can redirect the student or by using a grading system if they do all their work on time. the students can be graded by doing the work on time as students can be distracted and still understand what their learning. some people may also argue that the students are going to cheat as there will be no teacher with them checking but that will be stopped because students will need to learn the subject because they will take a test and if they don't pass the test, they will not receive the credits of that class. it will be up for the student and the parents for the success of the students passing because he will have the material to be able to learn and it's up to him/her to make sure the student is doing all the work and learning. students if they don't understand they can talk to a teacher about setting up a time for a video conferencing that will be their ""after school"" as they can do one on one talking with teachers.

be able to attend classes from home will be a great advancement in the learning environment and will be expanded if introduced more. it will ensure safety of students and parents won't worry of whereabouts and what their children are doing. students will have a easier way of accessing their education and won't need to worry about transportation. students won't have excuses to miss class because they will be able to do their classes online, anywhere they want. students will have the insurance of being able to pass as there is a higher passing rate online than in school inside a classroom. this can prove that having class at home is better and can benefit greatly if used correctly.",formality,0,5,4
21863-CFO,"schools are offering distance learning now, so students can take class online or through video calls. do you think students would get something good out of being able to go to class from home? yeah, i really think students doing classes at home would be a good thing 'cause online classes are working pretty well right now. and it’s good for parents too, 'cause it can be cheaper than sending kids to private school, and it's got some good educational reasons, it's easier to get to, and just a bunch of other reasons.

for example, with online classes and video calls, teachers can even work from home if they're sick! and when students are sick or out of the country, they can *still* do their classes. students don't have to miss class and not learn 'cause they can just chill at home and do all the work like they're at school. some kids learn faster or slower than others. with online classes, they can pick a pace that works for them – they can go slow or fast until they get it. actually, more students pass their classes when they’re doing online classes compared to regular school. a lot of students have a hard time learning in class 'cause the pace is too fast or they don't understand. in a video call, students can ask lots of questions, especially if it’s a smaller group. at school, there’s just one teacher trying to help like, 28 kids, and not all their questions are gonna get answered.

some students just don’t like going to school, especially if the school isn't very good. it could even be dangerous! people say going to school is distracting and can lead to bad behavior. like, relationships can mess with learning – kids skip class, get off track, and it affects how well they learn. plus, the bad influences they meet at school can change them. they could get into gangs or do stuff they shouldn’t. bullies can make school life awful, always picking on kids, hurting them physically and mentally, and hurting their confidence. a lot of parents who choose to have their kids learn at home is 'cause the school they’re going to probably isn't the best. parents can't always move to a better school or send their kids to private school, 'cause that’s too expensive. but having school online is a cheaper and better option.

some people might say that online school or video calls won’t work 'cause students won't pay attention and there's too much stuff distracting them at home. but with video calls, the teacher can redirect the student or use a grading system to make sure they’re doing the work. kids can still understand what they're learning even if they’re distracted. and some people might worry about cheating, but that won’t happen 'cause students need to learn the material to pass tests. if they don't pass, they don’t get credit. it’s up to the student and their parents to make sure the student is doing the work and learning. if students don’t understand something, they can talk to a teacher and set up a video call – like an “after school” – to talk one-on-one.

being able to go to class from home would be a really big step forward for learning, and it would get even better if more people used it. it would keep students safe and parents wouldn’t worry so much about where their kids are and what they’re doing. students would have an easier way to get their education and wouldn't have to worry about getting to school. they won't have excuses to miss class 'cause they can do it online, anywhere they want. and they're pretty much guaranteed to pass 'cause the passing rate is higher online than in a regular classroom. this shows that having class at home is better and can really help if people use it right.",formality,1,5,4

one way you can seek someone's opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. most people don't ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. for example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. i too have been in that type of problem. another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. to sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek people's opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice.

another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. one way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. one way i learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. the steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.one other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. a example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,one day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you don't known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now.

lastly,my final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. one way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. an example from my life i have is,one time i was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so i said why don't we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so i think my idea for what we should get was good,because i came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before.

in conclusion,seeking people's opinions on making a choice is good. i think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice.",formality,0,5,4

one way to get someone's opinion is to just ask them what *they* would do. like, if you had to make the same choice, what would you pick? a lot of people don't ask others what to do, 'cause they're worried people will make fun of them. for example, when you gotta choose between a toy and a video game. i’ve totally been there! or, like, wanting something really bad, but there's more than one thing you could get, and your friend is teasing you about what you want. basically, asking other people's opinions can help you make your choice.

another reason why you should ask others for advice is to get help making the *right* choice. one way to do that is to learn how to make a choice in the first place. i learned some steps from a book my mom got me. first, think about all your options. then, check which ones you like and which ones fit you. and finally, just make your choice! another way is to ask your friends and family for help. like, one time I was at the game store and saw two games I really wanted, but only had $70. I asked my brother which one to get, and he said the racing one. but i didn’t know if i should save up for both or just get one now.

lastly, asking other people’s opinions is good 'cause you can learn different ways to make decisions. one way is to think about all the stuff that could happen. another way is to ask your friends and family for ideas about which choices are the best for you. i remember one time I was at the ice cream shop with my brother, and we didn’t know what flavor to get. I was like, “Let’s try the new one!” 'cause we’re never tried it before. I thought my idea was good, 'cause we hadn’t even thought of that option before.

3605-O,"when the last day of school ends and summer begins, most students are happy to put their education on pause for a few months.

some schools, however, encourage students into continuing their education over their break through the assignment of summer projects.

these summer projects should be designed by teachers.

projects designed by teachers tend to be more well structured, and a teacher designed project would also be more challenging and engaging, encouraging students to continue learning over their season long break.

a summer project designed by a teacher would be better formatted than one designed by a student.

teachers have more experience than students when it comes to project design, and a well-designed project would make for a meaningful learning experience for students.

their experience would allow them to create a project that they know would be adequate in meeting the goals that a summer project wants to achieve, which is to encourage students to learn and enrich themselves during a long period of educational drought.

the teacher would also be able to design a balanced rubric to for the project, to ensure that all students learn the same, crucial research or analytical skills by completing the project.

a teacher designed project would be more equal; it would be less biased, as a student designed project would most likely be skewn to play towards their strengths, in order to make the task easier for them to complete.

teachers would make a summer project more challenging.

more challenging projects would result in a higher quality learning experience and would also be more engaging.

the higher difficulty a project is, the more effort a student has to put in in order to get a good grade.

a rubric designed by a student and a rubric designed by a teacher would be very different, as a student would be more likely to increase the point values of less difficult categories and decrease the point values of more challenging categories.

a teacher would be less likely to be biased and establish appropriate point values that vary by difficulty; meaning, higher points would be assigned to more difficult sections and lower point values for easier sections.

in my own experience, i have learned more from projects that have required more time and effort than those that required little effort.

for example, in an online course that i am taking, i am required to write an apa formatted paper every two weeks about a topic that i know little to nothing about.

this experience has taught me a great deal more than an easier project would have.

as these higher difficulty projects require more effort, this would effectively meet the goal of a summer project, and coerce students to keep learning and furthering their education during their break.

while a student-designed project would allow students the opportunity to learn about what they were interested in, a teacher-designed project could easily accomplish the same task.

a teacher-designed project that allows a student the freedom to learn and research topics that they find interesting, would combine the benefits of a student-designed project and a teacher-designed project.

the good formatting and difficulty of a teacher-designed project paired with the creative freedom of a student-designed project would result in an assignment that would allow a student to learn about topics that they find interesting, thus meeting the goal of a summer project.

allowing a student to choose what topic they research will also benefit them in long run, as tend to retain information that they find interesting, meaning that the project will not be completed just to start the new school year off with a good grade.

summer break is usually a time for fun and relaxation, but that does not mean there is no time for learning and enriching yourself.

summer projects encourage learning and enrichment, and a teacher-designed project would help to meet those goals more effectively than a student-designed project would.

teachers would make a better structured project than students would, due to their experience with project design.

a teacher's project would also be more difficult and therefore more engaging for students, as a teacher would not be biased and make the project extremely easy.

in conclusion, a teacher-designed project would more effectively enrich a student's summer than a student-designed project would. ",formality,0,5,4

these summer projects should be made by teachers, not students.

when teachers make the projects, they’re usually better and more challenging, which helps kids keep learning during their long break.

a teacher-made project would be way better than one a student makes.

teachers know way more about making projects than students do, and a good project makes learning fun and helpful.

they know how to make a project that's just right to help kids learn and grow during a time when school’s out.

the teacher can also make a fair way to grade the project, so everyone learns the same important stuff like research and thinking skills.

a teacher's project would be more fair; a student's project might be easy 'cause they'd just make it about what they're good at.

teachers would make the summer project harder.

harder projects are better 'cause they make learning more fun and make you work harder.

if a student makes the grading, they’d probably give lots of points to the easy parts and not so many for the hard ones.

a teacher would be less likely to be biased and give points based on how hard something is, so harder parts get more points and easier parts get fewer.

i've learned way more from projects that took a lot of time and work than from ones that were super easy.

like, in an online class i'm taking, i gotta write a paper every two weeks about stuff i don't know anything about.

that’s taught me so much more than an easy project would have.

'cause harder projects make you try harder, it helps kids keep learning and getting smarter during their break.

yeah, a student-made project lets you pick what you're interested in, but a teacher can do that too.

a teacher could make a project that lets you learn about what you like, so you get the best of both worlds.

a teacher’s project is well-made and challenging, and a student’s project lets you be creative, so you learn about stuff you're interested in and hit the goal of a summer project.

letting you pick what you research is good for you in the long run, 'cause you remember stuff you find interesting, so you don’t just do the project for a good grade.

summer break is for fun and relaxing, but that doesn't mean you can't learn stuff too.

summer projects help you learn and grow, and a teacher-made project helps do that better than a student-made one.

teachers are just better at making projects 'cause they’ve done it before.

and a teacher’s project would be harder, so it’s more fun for you, 'cause they won't make it super easy.

4256-O,"how can students continue to learn over the summer? summer break is the longest break of the year for most students, and many students tend to not maintain what they had learned during the school year. naturally teachers would want their students to continue learning over the break. in order to do so teachers might assign summer projects, that way their students don't stop learning over the 2 month break and are able to maintain what they already learned from the school year. most summer projects that are teacher-designed bring the stresses of the school year, such as deadlines or requirements, into summer break. that's why these summer projects should be student-designed as it would provide the students with more freedom, an increased interest in what they learn, and less stress over the course of the project.

having a student-designed summer project would allow for students to feel an increased sense of freedom. if the project were to be student-designed, then the students will feel more free because they'd be able to do their project based off of what they like, which would increase their interest in the subject of their project. with an increased sense of freedom, students will enjoy the project rather than feel as if it was just another assignment they needed to do for school. the feeling of freedom would increase their interest in the subject of their project because students would have the opportunity to design the project on what they like. this means that the students would put in more effort into the project, as they would feel they are doing what they like to do and not what they have to do. the increase in effort means that the quality of the project would be better. this is because the students would have a genuine interest in what they were doing. if summer projects were student-designed, then the students would feel more freedom, which would increase their interest in what they were meant to learn. this would lead to students putting in more effort into their project, which will make the quality of the project better, and they would enjoy the project more.

when students enjoy the project, they tend to stress over it less. summer break is meant to be a time where students shouldn't have to worry about the stresses of school. it should be a time where the students feel stress free, and free to do what they want. if the students get to decide their own projects, then they would feel less stressed out because the project would be on their own terms. they would get to decide what they wanted, and how they wanted to do it. this would cause less stress because the students would become their own teachers. they would get to learn without having to feel the stressful deadlines or requirements of the teacher-designed assignments they have during the school year. a student-designed summer project is be better for the students themselves because they wouldn't feel the stress that teacher-designed assignments bring during the school year.

summer break is a time where students get to relax and not worry about the stresses of the school year. the break is meant for students to relax from school, but the majority of students relax too much and end up losing what they learned throughout the school year. the best way to solve this problem would be to assign summer projects that the students could do to maintain what they had learned in the school year, while learning more during the summer. instead of these projects being teacher-designed, like all the work the students have already done in the school year, the projects should be student-designed. this would lead to students feeling more free, more interested, and less stressed by their projects. they would learn better as the students would genuinely want to do the project, and they wouldn't feel as if they had to do the project. it can be difficult to maintain what you learn from the school year, but if students got to design their own project, they would continue to learn throughout the course of the summer in a healthy, stress-free way.",formality,0,5,4

there are multiple students that have quite a few responsibilities outside of school. for example, there are students who have jobs, chores, and homework to complete. everyone has a different situation. what if there is a student who has a sick relative, or a sibling they care for after school? what happens when there is no one else to fill that students role as caretaker? that student can't neglect there responsibilities to take part in an extracurricular activity they are forced to participate in. by making this decision, not only are we being forced to participate in activities we might not have time for, but we are also being forced to put our priorities on hold and juggle more tasks than we can handle.

the main reason we go to school is to gain knowledge and obtain skills to help us become successful. the principal's decision to make participating in extracurricular activities mandatory could take students' focus away from learning and make completing school work difficult. for instance, students who play sports have to stay after school and do not not arrive home until late evening hours. those students are being deprived of extra hours that could have been used to study, do homework, or catch up in a class they are behind in. some students already struggle with classes, and by adding extracurricular activities to their plate, it would only make it more difficult for them. our principal should be focused on making our education the main priority, not prioritizing activities that will not cause significant benefits.

every individual has the right to make their own decisions. students' freedoms are being limited by the principal's decision to make participating in extracurricular activities a requirement. there are students who are just simply uninterested in these activities, and do not want to participate in them. it should be our choice, as students, to decide our interest and the activities we take part in. adults are not forced to work at a specific job, or even forced to go to work at all. likewise, student's should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities. we have the complete capability to make decisions for ourselves and we can not allow the principal to take away our freedom of choice. if we allow this one freedom to be taken away, we can only expect to be limited to even more freedoms in the future.

i strongly encourage our principal to rethink his decision on requiring all students to participate in extracurricular activities. this decision fully impacts the students, and we should be allowed to have a say in the matter. we are being forced to put our priorities on hold, try to maintain focus, and be limited to our freedoms. students have to stand up for themselves and we have to take back control of our lives.     ",formality,0,5,4

there’s a bunch of kids who already have a lot to do outside of school. like, some kids have jobs, chores, and homework! everyone’s situation is different. what if there’s a kid who has a sick family member, or has to watch their little brother after school? what if that kid *has* to do that, and there’s nobody else? that kid can’t just ditch their responsibilities to do an after-school thing they didn’t even wanna do. by making this rule, we’re not just being forced to do stuff we don’t have time for, but we’re also being forced to put our important stuff on hold and do way more than we can handle.

the main reason we go to school is to learn and get skills to be successful. the principal’s rule about after-school stuff could make kids forget about learning and make it hard to finish their schoolwork. for example, kids who play sports have to stay late and don’t get home 'til super late. those kids are missin’ out on hours they could use to study, do homework, or catch up in a class they’re behind in. some kids already have a hard time in class, and adding after-school stuff would just make it even harder. our principal should be focused on makin’ sure we learn, not makin’ a big deal out of stuff that won’t really help.

everyone gets to make their own choices. the principal’s rule is takin’ away our freedom. there are kids who just aren’t interested in these activities, and don’t wanna do ‘em. it should be *our* choice to pick what we like and what we wanna do. grown-ups don’t get forced to work at a specific job, or even forced to go to work at all. so, students shouldn’t be forced to do after-school stuff. we can totally make decisions for ourselves, and we can’t let the principal take away our freedom. if we let this one freedom go, we can only expect to lose even more freedoms later on.

i really hope our principal will think about changin’ his mind about makin’ everyone do after-school stuff. this rule affects us students, and we should get a say in it. we’re being forced to put our important stuff on hold, try to focus, and lose our freedom. students gotta stand up for themselves, and we gotta take back control of our lives.",formality,1,5,4
19307-O,"the electoral college is an unfair and outdated system. it is unfair to voters. a states electoral votes often do not tell what that state truly wants. and no candidate should face what gore did in 2000, with a winning popular vote, but less electoral votes losing him the election. it is an outdated system that should not be used in today's modern society.

when we vote for a specific president, we are actually voting for a slate of electors. the chosen electors are supposed to support the winning candidate, but they can easily decide to ignore that and cast their vote toward whomever the please. this can cause a president to get the greatest popular vote, and still lose because they did not get as many electoral college votes once all states' votes have been combined. this should certainly not happen. whatever candidate is preferred by the most people to take office should win the election, period. in the past, maybe it would have been good to let the more educated electors choose the president rather than any citizen, but in this modern age of knowledge, people can be trusted to choose a leader that shares in the best interests of our country. al gore in 2000 lost the election after winning the most popular votes. that shows us that this electoral system does not work effectively, and should not be used today.

perhaps more worrying is the electoral college's winner-take-all system. if a candidate wins a state's election by a tiny amount, they get every electoral vote for that state. this allows candidates to ignore smaller states, or states they know they will win, and focus on larger states and ones that have a very tight election could be easily persuaded for advertisements and campaigns. ohio is known as a state that looks at their candidates closely, and can be persuaded to choose one based on what they know about them. candidates tend to focus more resources here or in other similar states. it makes some sense to focus more on larger populations, and states like ohio that are more interested in the election, but during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, and could not make educated descisions during the election. in a close election, half the people in the state's views will be ignored, and will not matter to the elction. that means half of california's 35 million voters would not matter at all in the election. the fate of the election should not be put in the hands of ohio or other ""swing"" states, just ignoring less important ones.

today's society needs a more fair system of electing a president. a popular vote from everyone is the most fair way to make sure the most popular candidate wins the election, and will cause candidates to focus on all citizens, focusing on large populations, but still trying to gain popularity with rural areas as well. america's citizens deserve a fair, proper election, that satisfies the most people possible.    ",formality,0,5,4
19307-CFO,"the electoral college is just, like, a really unfair and old-fashioned system. it's not fair to voters, ya know? a state’s electoral votes often don’t even show what that state really wants. and no one should have gone through what gore did in 2000, winning the popular vote but losing ‘cause he didn’t get enough electoral votes. it's an old system and shouldn’t be used anymore, really.

when we vote for president, we're actually voting for a bunch of electors. these electors are supposed to vote for the winning candidate, but they could just decide to do whatever they want and vote for someone else. this means a candidate can get the most votes overall and still lose ‘cause they didn’t get enough electoral college votes when all the states’ votes are added up. that’s just not right. the person most people want in office should win, plain and simple. maybe a long time ago, it was okay to let smarter electors pick the president instead of regular people, but now, people know stuff too, and we can trust them to choose a leader who’s good for our country. al gore lost in 2000 even though he got the most popular votes. that just shows the system doesn’t work, and we shouldn't be using it.

and it’s even kinda scary how the electoral college works – winner-take-all. if a candidate wins a state by just a little bit, they get *all* of that state’s electoral votes. this lets candidates ignore smaller states, or states they know they’re gonna win, and focus on bigger states and ones that are really close. ohio, for example, looks at candidates really closely and can be convinced to choose someone based on what they know. candidates spend a lot of money on ads and stuff there. it makes sense to focus on bigger populations, but during the 2000 election, seventeen states didn't even *see* the candidates, so they couldn't even make a good choice. in a close election, half the people in a state don’t even matter! that means half of California’s 35 million voters wouldn't count. the election shouldn't be decided by ohio or other ""swing"" states, just ignoring everyone else.

we need a fairer way to pick a president now. just counting all the votes – a popular vote – is the fairest way to make sure the person most people want wins. and that means candidates will have to focus on *all* citizens, not just big cities, but also smaller towns too. america’s citizens deserve a fair election, one that makes most people happy.",formality,1,5,4
22949-O,"school is a place where students are supposed to be able to learn information and grow as human beings. the main problem with school being a place where students must commute to, is that for some of the students, the environment just isn't the right place for them to learn. personally, i believe that for some students, learning from home may be a much more beneficial method of schooling. the reasons for this are: some students feel uncomfortable with the school environment and online school could allow for more freedom in class pacing.

a school in it's own can sometimes feel much too clinical for students, too professional, and way too pressuring of an environment. this is why for some students, it may actually be better if they learn from home. for me at least, i find school to be a suffocating environment, where you are surrounded by the pressure of other students and other teachers. one wrong move and your grade could be failing, and you have to face your teacher with that fact. the way i see it, that is way too much pressure to put on a student, for them to feel scared in an environment that is supposed to feel nurturing and calm. instead, school feels like a prison, and the strict rules and guidelines are what push students to fail. this is why i believe that if students work from home, they will feel much more relaxed, and thus will do much better in classes. students have a comfort zone, and sometimes a school building and environment crosses that comfort zone, which causes for poor performance. if school was taught from home or online, students would feel more comfortable and thus would do better.

if school was taught online, student would be able to control their class pacing much better than if it was taught in person. in a normal classroom, your teacher has a strict course schedule that he/she must keep to, and thus forcing students to keep to a strict routine of coursework. i can say this from my personal experience, since i too have dealt with the pressure of having multiple assignments due back to back, and having to turn them in on time or else my grade would suffer for my ignorance. classes force students of differing levels of learning to all adapt to the same course schedule, with no room for fluctuation, and this is why their grades suffer. if school was to be taught from home or online, while there would still be due dates, it would not have to be as strict. students could have more freedom to choose how their assignments are to get done and when they needed to be completed. instead of being forced into some strict class schedule, students would have the rights and the freedom to choose, and i believe that you would see a great difference in their grades. this is why i will argue for school to be taught from home or online, since students would greatly benefit from it.

school should be taught from home or taught online, because i believe that most, if not all, students would benefit from it. students would not have to deal with the harsh environment of a school and they would get ability to decide their class pacing better then in school teaching. i believe that all teachers want is for their students to succeed, but how can a student excel when the school system is dampening their motivations with poor environments. as a student myself, i can say with absolute certainty that i would benefit from having school from home. i would not have to feel the pressure of a harsh testing environment and i would never have to deal with teachers, who were frustrated that i could not complete their too many assignments on their due dates. students need fluidity, and the rigid structure of our school system today is not helping them to succeed. the only way that i see that students would be able to act on full capacity would be to switch to a completely online school system. ",formality,0,5,4
22949-CFO,"school is a place where students are supposed to learn stuff and grow up, right? but the thing is, for some kids, just going to school isn's the best place for them to learn. like, seriously. i think for some students, learning from home could be way better. here's why: some kids just don’t feel comfy at school, and online school could give them more freedom with how fast they learn stuff.

school can feel kinda cold and strict sometimes, ya know? way too professional and stressful. that’s why it might actually be better for some kids to learn from home. for me, at least, school feels like it's closing in on me, with all the pressure from other students and teachers. one wrong move and your grade could tank, and then you gotta face your teacher about it. that’s just too much pressure, especially when school is supposed to feel safe and chill. instead, it feels like a prison, and all the rules just make kids want to fail. that’s why i think if kids worked from home, they’d feel way more relaxed, and do better in their classes. everyone has a comfort zone, and sometimes a school building and the way it feels crosses that line, which makes kids do badly. if school was online, kids would feel better and do better, easy.

if school was online, kids could control how fast they learn way better than in a regular classroom. in a normal class, the teacher has a schedule they gotta stick to, so kids are forced to do stuff at a certain pace. i’ve been there, ya know? i’ve had tons of assignments due back-to-back, and if you don’t turn them in on time, your grade suffers. classes make kids who learn at different speeds all have to fit the same schedule, and that’s why their grades suffer. if school was online, there’s still due dates, but they wouldn’t have to be so strict. kids could have more freedom to choose how they get their work done and when they need to finish it. instead of being stuck to a strict schedule, kids could choose, and i think you’d see a big difference in their grades. that’s why i’m saying school should be online, because kids would really benefit from it.

school should be online because i think most, if not all, kids would do better. they wouldn’t have to deal with a harsh school environment, and they’d be able to decide their class pacing better. i think teachers just want their students to succeed, but how can a student do well when the school system is bringing them down? as a student myself, i can totally say that i’m sure i’d do better learning from home. i wouldn’t have to feel the stress of tests, and i wouldn’t have to deal with teachers who get mad because i can’t finish all their assignments on time. kids need to be able to move around and do things at their own pace, and the way schools are now isn’t helping them do that. the only way i see kids being able to do their best is if we switch to a completely online school.",formality,1,5,4
3261-O,"summertime is a time for students to take a break from school. taking a break, however, comes at a cost. during summer, students tend to forget things they learned in the past school year. this is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure students continue learning, even during summer. these projects should be student based because it can be used as incentive to work, gives students more options, and makes sure everyone can do them. when it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control. when students design their own projects, everybody wins.

during summer, it's hard to do school work when there's no school. some students may find it hard to find ways to work while others may not even try. giving students the ability to choose what to do can combat this problem by giving them incentive to work. when giving students the ability to choose, they are more likely to work on the projects. in addition, not only will they want to do the projects, but enjoy them, since the assignments are on the student's terms. giving students more freedom when it comes to learning can strengthen their minds and help them grow.

when the projects are teacher-designed, that means every student gets the same prompt. while this might be fine for some students, there's no way of satisfying every student. letting students design their projects can make sure every student does what they want. if students were to design their own projects, then every student can be satisfied with what they do. student-designed projects can also create diversity, ensuring every student's project is different in their own way. more choice when it comes to projects makes students more prone towards things they want to learn and might be able to learn new skills.

another problem students may face is the inability to do the projects. while some students may be able to accomplish the objectives of the projects, others might be incapable. letting students design their own projects makes everyone capable of completing them. when designing their own projects, students will work with the resources around them and make sure that the project is able to be accomplished. at some point if the student runs into a problem, instead of going through the hassle of contacting a teacher and figuring out what can be changed, they can change the projects to their own standards, saving time and energy. some people, however, may not agree with these reasons.

people can still argue that teacher-designed projects are more successful. while it is true that if teachers designed the projects, every student will at least have something to work on, teacher-designed projects aren't the better option. even though every student has a project idea, not every student has the means of accomplishing them. even if they were, there's no tell whether they will like doing it or not. students that don't like the project are more reluctant to finish or even start. while teacher-designed projects have one advantage, they also have many disadvantages.

in conclusion, students should be in charge of designing their own projects during the summer. first, student-designed projects can give more incentive to students and encourage them to complete their projects. second, student-designed projects give more options and freedom to students. finally, giving students the ability to choose their own projects makes sure that each student can complete their projects. when it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control.",formality,0,5,4

when teachers pick the projects, that means every student gets the same thing. that might be okay for some students, but there’s no way to make everyone happy. lettin’ students design their own projects can make sure every student does somethin' they like. if students designed their own projects, then everyone could be happy with what they're doin'. student-designed projects can also be different for everyone, makin' sure every student’s project is unique in its own way. more choice when it comes to projects makes students more into learnin' and they might even learn new stuff.

another problem students might face is not bein’ able to do the projects. some students might be able to do what the projects ask for, but others might not. lettin’ students design their own projects makes sure everyone can do ‘em. when they design their own projects, students will use what's around 'em and make sure the project can be done. if a student runs into a problem, instead of havin’ to talk to a teacher and figure out what can be changed, they can just change the project themselves, savin' time and energy. some people, though, might not agree with these reasons.

12895-O,"the face on mars is not an alien creation. it is a natural landform. evidence to support this claim includes: this landform is similar to ones found on earth that were created naturally, the technology is extremely advanced to where we would know if alien life existed, and nasa would share any evidence of life on mars if any is found.

the face on mars is much like natural landforms found here on earth, specifically in the western part of north america. it is called a mesa. in the article, ""unmasking the face on mars,"" garvin says, ""it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho."" because the atmospheres and climates of earth and mars are similar, it is very possible that the same type of natural landforms could be created on both planets. there has even been evidence supporting the claim that water previously existed on mars, which could have caused erosion that formed the face.

technology has improved drastically within the last few decades. specific to this research, cameras are part of that new and improved technology. nasa was able to capture outstanding photographs of the face. it is stated in the article, ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."" with these sharper images, the face no longer looked like a face. the conditions were different as well. on a cloudless day, mars global surveyor captured more images of the face. it looked like an ordinary landform.

there has never been any solid official evidence of life on the red planet. people think nasa may be hiding their findings of aliens on mars. however, in paragraph five of the article, it says, ""... evidence that nasa would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. meanwhile, defenders of the nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" nasa would definetly share any evidence of alien life with the public because that would be great publicity for them. it would be huge news that would spread across the world. nasa would benifit greatly from this because of all the money it would bring in.

in conclusion, the face on mars is not an alien formation, but a natural landform that happened to resemble a human face at one point. some people will continue to believe that aliens do exist, but as of right now, no solid evidence has proven that theory. these are just a few reasons that support the face as being a landform that was created naturally, but nasa has many more. as more technology is developed and nasa delves deeper into uncovering the secrets of mars, we will anxiously await any new discoveries.

this face thing looks a whole lot like landforms we’re used to seeing, especially in the western part of north america. it's called a mesa. in this article, ""unmasking the face on mars,"" this guy garvin says it reminds him of middle butte in idaho. since the air and weather on earth and mars are kinda similar, it's pretty possible that the same kinds of landforms could be made on both planets. plus, there's even been stuff showing that water used to be on mars, which could have worn it down and shaped it.

tech has gotten way better in the last few years. and cameras are a big part of that. nasa got some really good pictures of the face. the article says, ""each pixel in the 2001 picture is like, 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the old 1976 viking photo.” so, with these clearer pictures, the face doesn't look like a face anymore. the conditions were different, too. on a clear day, mars global surveyor took more pictures, and it just looked like a regular landform.

there's never been any real proof of alien life on mars. some people think nasa is hiding stuff. but the article says, ""…evidence that nasa would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.” but other people wish there *was* an ancient civilization on mars. nasa would totally share any proof of alien life with everyone because that would be huge news! it would be like, the biggest story ever! nasa would get a ton of money from it too.

so, yeah, the face on mars isn't some alien thing, it’s just a landform that kinda looked like a face once. some people will still think aliens are out there, but right now, there’s no real proof of it. these are just a few reasons why i think it’s a natural landform, and nasa has even more. as we get better tech and nasa keeps exploring mars, we’re all gonna be waiting to see what they find next.",formality,1,5,4
22463-O,"a lot of accidents and misfortunes can happen without expecting it. kids and teens can catch a sickness and have to be confined to a bed for months, being unable to move. once they recover, they'll realize that they've missed a whole month of school, missing a heap of work and a couple of tests. they'll feel dreaded from thinking of all of the work that they'll have to catch up on. these students would be able to catch up with their classmate easier if they were able to do their work at home. students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will able to catch up with work while sick or injured and can work at their own pace.

students will have the ability to attempt to catch up if they're sick or injured to the point where they can't even try to walk properly. any student who happened to be in a car accident for example, they'll still be able to manage their way to get some of their work out. having a pile of homework and classwork to do is not easy from the perspective of a child that's trying to recover from a disease pr injury, maybe even surgery. any accident has a possibility of happening and there;s no real way of changing if it can or can't happen. students shouldn't have to worry about the amount of work they have to do because they were out of school, but should only worry about their recovery.

students can work the amount of work that needs to be done at their own pace. some kids work faster than others and are told to slow down. some kids work slower than others and are told to speed up. being able to work at home will remove these pressures off of them and let them work how fast they are willing to work. this help students by not feeling rushed to do what needs to be done, letting the same students to not have to guess on questions they have to think or work out. instead they could just study a little bit, go back to the question, and then continue to finish up any problems they had without having to be concerned about the speed of their work.

some people may argue that being able to attend classes at home would make student lazy or that it would defeat the purpose of school. or that some kids may act sick just so that they could stay at home. these reasons or understandable, but the students who are in need of attending classes at home should be given that necessity. only the students who can't come to school for any reason should be able to take their classes at home or where they are. it's better this way so that when the student comes back to their school, they aren't forced to do a pound of work that's due in a week. it's simply more effective this way than not letting students do their work at home.

in conclusion, being able to attend classes at home would be a benefit to some kids. students could work at home if they are sick or injured and they won't need to be in any type of rush to do their missing work. though they are thought to be some downsides, the pros easily out wight the cons. students need to be able to do their work on their time so that when they go back to school, they won't have to worry about the amount of work that's missing. rather, they'll have to worry about what;s being taught in their respective classes. letting kids, teens, and adults do their school work at home could help them majorly in the long run.",formality,0,5,4

kids work at different speeds, right? some kids are told to slow down, and some are told to speed up. being able to work at home takes that pressure off and lets them work as fast or slow as they wanna. that helps students 'cause they don’t feel rushed to do stuff, letting them figure out questions they need to think about. instead of guessing, they could just study a little, go back to the question, and finish up any problems without worrying about how fast they’re working.

some people might say that letting students take classes at home would make them lazy or ruin school. or that some kids would just pretend to be sick so they could stay home. yeah, that's understandable, but the students who really need to take classes at home should be able to. only the students who can't come to school should be able to do their classes at home or wherever they are. it's way better 'cause when they come back to school, they won’t have a huge pile of work due in a week. it’s just more effective than not letting students do their work at home.

3836-O,"it has been estimated that during summer break, roughly 75 percent of students fail to retain critical information for their next year's classes. this is quite detrimental to a student's overall education, considering time will have to be spent relearning old information instead of new material. because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects, with the goal of keeping students learning even during their break. these summer projects should be created by teachers, enhancing the concept that authority plays a role in maintaining steady educational progress.

teachers are far more familiar with the curriculum than students. teachers have spent years in the education system and know best how to prepare students for success in that environment. teachers will on average spend four to five years attaining a degree in education, and will then spend the majority of their working years in the school system. having spent so much time in and around the school system, they will have become incredibly familiar with the curriculum. this inherently generates an unparalleled level of experience with the material which teachers can effectively utilize to create projects that will better fit the education of their students.

teachers are more suited to designing projects that will relate to the next year's material. the majority of students do not know exactly what to expect heading into their next year of education. specifically, one may know that they are taking calculus next year, but they will not know the level of importance past information holds in the upcoming class. teachers, who have been dealing with the material surrounding their class for years, know all that which is relevant to the class, and how to design a project that will suit the necessary concepts. because of the fact that teachers have spent so much time around the curriculum, by nature they will create projects which are far more effective in helping students retain or even learn new information during the summer break.

some believe that students should be the ones to design their summer assignments; however, this belief is faulty. humans, and students especially, tend to live by the motto, ""work smarter, not harder."" if given free reign or even partial credit in designing a summer project, the final product will be something so elementary that the students might as well have done nothing at all. consider how students more often than not take advantage of late work deadlines, then think of how that might translate into the creation of a summer project. a summer project is not to be taken lightly, the whole point for its existence is to retain and potentially improve upon information learned last which will be critical for next year. students will naturally take the easy way out on a summer project, and need an authority figure, namely a teacher, who is experienced enough in the curriculum to create a project for them.

teachers have an unrivaled level of experience in creating projects. a teacher's whole day is concerned with illustrating new concepts and ideas, and figuring out creative ways to demonstrate them. teachers will on average create about 80-100 different lessons, tests, study guides, and projects. through all of this they will obtain vital information on how to structure these assignments in ways that will effectively stimulate the students learning. with all the experience a teacher gains from having created so many projects before, they will be able to create an excellent summer project that will keep their students in good shape for their upcoming classes.

teachers are far better suited to creating summer assignments because of the need for authority in educational success. in all the aforementioned reasoning, one thing has remained clear, that teachers, the older and more experienced party, are unquestionably better suited to designing summer projects. subordinate students will naturally create easy assignments that would minimize the required effort, especially since the project is to be completed over the summer break. teachers; however, wouldn't necessarily create needlessly arduous projects, simply ones that would require the students to think on a high level. the necessity of an authority figure in education is paramount, and the importance of the teacher in designing summer projects is just an extension of that concept.",formality,0,6,4
3836-CFO,"it’s been said that like, 75 percent of students totally forget stuff over summer break – like, a lot! that’s not good, 'cause then teachers have to waste time going over stuff they already taught. so, some schools make kids do summer projects to keep them learning, even when they're supposed to be relaxing. and I think teachers should be the ones making these projects, 'cause they're the experts, ya know?

teachers just *get* the curriculum way more than students do. they’re in the education game for years, and they know what it takes to help kids succeed. they spend like, four or five years just getting their teaching degrees, and then they work in schools for ages. that means they know the lessons inside and out. they've got tons of experience that they can use to make projects that will really help kids learn.

teachers are just better at figuring out what kids will need to know next year. most kids don't really know what to expect. like, you might know you’re taking calculus, but you won’t know what stuff from past classes is gonna be important. teachers, who have been dealing with this stuff for years, know everything that's important and how to make a project that fits. 'cause they know the curriculum so well, they’ll make projects that actually help kids remember stuff or even learn new things over the summer.

some people think students should make their own summer assignments, but that's just not a good idea. kids, especially, always want to “work smarter, not harder.” if they got to design a project, it’s gonna be super easy, like they didn't even do anything at all. think about how often kids try to get away with turning stuff in late – imagine what they'd do with a summer project! a summer project isn't just for show, it's to help kids keep learning and get ready for next year. kids will just take the easy way out, and they need a teacher, someone with experience, to make a project for them.

teachers are really good at making projects. it’s their job to explain new ideas and find cool ways to show them. they probably make like, 80-100 different lessons, tests, and projects every year! they learn a lot about how to structure things so kids will actually learn. with all that experience, they can make awesome summer projects that get kids ready for their classes.

teachers are just better at making summer assignments 'cause we need someone in charge to make sure things go right. teachers, who have more experience, are just gonna do a better job. kids will probably make projects that are too easy, just to get it over with. teachers won’t make them super hard, just ones that make kids think. it's important to have someone in charge in school, and letting teachers make summer projects is just part of that.",formality,1,6,4
4896-O,"in the story ""a cowboy who rode the waves"" it gives information about a certain group called the seagoing cowboys program. one reason to join the seagoing cowboys program is you get to take care of animals for your service to your country in stead of having to be in the military. according to the fourth paragraph when luke turned eighteen before getting to greece, he would've had to automatically draft into the military. but, when the draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to just stay their for his service. point being if you serve by being a seagoing cowboy you wouldn't have to be in the military enless you choose to be in it.

there are many reason's provided in the story to be a seagoing cowboy but one that also seems to stick out above some of the others is the sight's you see. according to paragraph five it says ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""besides helping people, i had the side benefit of seeing europe and china. but seeing the acropolis in greece wasspecial,"" he says.""so was taking a gondola ride in venice, italy, a city with streets of water."" luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china."" which means that if you're a seagoing cowboy you get to see a bunch of unique places that most people don't get to see everyday.

for my last reason that i found stated in the text to be a seagoing cowboy is it opens up a new world for you. as stated in the text paragraph nine ""but being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. it opened up the world to him."" which shows that it teaches you and what caring for others does for you and last it shows sights you don't get to see 24/7. to conclude the paragraph being a seagoing cowboy is much more than seeing things you haven't seen before outside of pictures and going on adventures it's a great learning experience.

if you join the seagoing cowboys program you will get the great delight of caring for others, adventure, sight-seeing, and a great learning experience. all the information above is my reason's or benefits of being a seagoing cowboy. think about the reason's to see if being a seagoing cowboy is what you want to be. if it is then please call: 555-2424.",formality,0,4,4

there are lots of reasons to be a seagoing cowboy, but seeing cool stuff really stands out. paragraph five says ""the cattle-boat trips were a crazy chance for a small-town kid,"" he says. ""besides helping people, i got to see Europe and China! Seeing the acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says. ""So was riding a gondola in Venice, Italy, a city with water streets."" Luke also saw an old castle in Crete and checked out the Panama Canal on his way to China. so, being a seagoing cowboy lets you see a bunch of places most people don't get to see every day.

another reason I think being a seagoing cowboy is awesome is it opens up a whole new world for you. paragraph nine says ""but being a seagoing cowboy was way more than just an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him.” That shows you learn stuff, and what it’s like to care for others, and you get to see sights you don’t see all the time. so, being a seagoing cowboy is way more than just seeing places you’d usually only see in pictures and going on adventures, it’s a really good learning experience.

if you join the seagoing cowboys program, you’re gonna get to help people, have adventures, see cool places, and learn a lot. all the stuff above is why I think being a seagoing cowboy is a good thing. think about the reasons to see if being a seagoing cowboy is for you. if it is, give ‘em a call: 555-2424.",formality,1,4,2
24883-O,"why is it impirtant to have multiple people give you advice? some peple might need more than one persons edvice to get different perspectives. other people might need multiple people so they can have back up with them about the situation. but everyone has their own opinion on situations. or some people might really need some help with the situation. finally lets talk about why i think these reasons.

first,i think the reason why some people might need multiple people for advice is because the are going to need different perspectives. most people that think through things and brainstorm in their head what their going to do, they would most likely want other peoples opinions on it. other people might have different perspectives about some things and they might want to hear what other people have to say about it. strangers might be the best to talk to because of the opinion that different veriodes and catergories that people may have. there are different people in this world that people are gong to want to have cause of what they have to say about different catergories. finally thats what i have to say about this first reason why i think people might want multiple people.

second,another reason why i think some people might want multiple people is because they might want back up to help with the situation. now if their family is like my famile then thats great becuase my family likes to get in drama and likes to back me up when i need then. for some people they might need more than just their self to deal or go through the situation with. now look im not saying to fo and fight and drag other people into the situaion im saying to just express whats happening. thats the conclusion on my second reason.

third,reason why i think people might want multiple people advice or some thing is beause they actualy might need help. most people might just handle the situation way differently then others might. like i know if im in a situation im going to want multipe peoples advice to see what the best route to go on. now some people might just go through that sage where they are just stuck in the moment and dosen't know how to get out. that is my third reason why i think some people might want multiple advice.

finally thats all the reasons i think some people might want multiple peoples advice. for some people they might want other peoples opinions for them to choose which way they wanna go with the situation. other people might just wanna be on their own with the situation. you just have to take your time and go dy by day. you should just try yur best and do what your heart desires to do.",formality,0,3,4

first off, I think some people need more than one person to talk to 'cause they wanna hear different ideas. most people think stuff over in their head, right? and they probably wanna know what other folks think too. other people might have totally different views on things, and they wanna hear what other people have to say about it. sometimes strangers are good to talk to, 'cause they have different opinions, like, different ways of looking at stuff. there's all kinds of people out there, and you might wanna hear what they think about different things. that's what I think about that first reason, ya know?

second, another reason why some people want multiple people is 'cause they need someone to back 'em up, like, to help 'em through it. like, if your family’s like mine, that's great 'cause my family likes to get into drama and backs me up when I need it. some people just can’t deal with stuff on their own, ya know? I’m not saying go out there and fight and drag people into your problems, I'm just saying, it helps to talk about what's going on. that’s my second reason, pretty simple.

third, a reason why people might want multiple people's advice is 'cause they actually need help, like, real help. most people handle situations totally different ways. like, when I’m in a sticky situation, I wanna hear what a bunch of people think is the best way to go. sometimes people get stuck, ya know? like, they’re just in a moment and don’t know how to get out. that’s my third reason, simple as that.

finally, that’s all the reasons I think some people might want multiple people's advice. some people wanna hear what other people think so they can pick a way to go. other people just wanna deal with it on their own. you just gotta take it one day at a time, ya know? just try your best and do what your heart wants you to do.",formality,1,3,4
22572-O,"do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

i don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. first, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. for example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. for example: everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. for example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. for example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. for example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. that's why i think is nice to get classes at school and i think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

in another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.      ",formality,0,3,4
22572-CFO,"do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

i don't think students would really get anything good from being able to do classes from home. first off, when you’re at home, you don’t have a teacher telling you what to do or pushing you. like, if a student doesn't wanna do what they gotta do, nobody’s gonna tell ‘em. for example, it’s just easy to skip stuff. second, kids who do online classes don’t really get any friends or anyone to talk to. like, everyone wants a friend, right? if you stay home all the time, you never meet people and you don't know anyone. third, students might just get, like, super lonely at home. for example, watching videos online can be boring, and it can stress you out. when you're at school, you're with your friends and you got people to talk to. next, if you’re at home, you can just do whatever you want. like, wanna play video games? go for it! wanna sleep? sure! you don’t feel any responsibility. plus, you can go outside whenever you want 'cause your parents are probably working all day anyway. finally, if you just do classes at home and never go to school, you miss out on stuff. like, you can’t play sports or go to parties or do anything that’s, like, really fun with your friends and teachers. Teachers are, like, a safe place to talk too, you can tell them anything and they won’t tell nobody. that’s why I think it's good to go to school and I don't think it's so good to do classes at home 'cause you can have more fun at school, and it’s an experience you’ll never forget.

and, like, if you don't wanna go to school 'cause someone's being mean, like calling you a nickname you don't like, that’s a reason. but you can talk to your advisor or your parents 'cause everybody has a chance to be at school, and nobody can tell you what to do.",formality,1,3,4
