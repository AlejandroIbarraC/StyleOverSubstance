i believe that you should stick with the electoral college, because i don't really care about any of this. but you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. also i say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. i don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it.

i also don't care to much for government. but if i did i would try to read the whole passage and give you a really good essay to read. but i don't and im not that sorry either and don't care. if your really want somones opinion you should ask someone who doesn't care ask one that does because then you would get a good answer but not from me.

also next time you want to give me a passage don't give me one on the government. because frankly no one im my grade will care because i certeny do not. but thats just my opinion. and i know that repeating things in an essay is bad but really, you need to give this passage to someone that care thats not me. and no one reallt cares about the fiasco in 2000 or any other year for that matter and you can't make them. also if someone says that can't wright on a spicific topic belive them and try to change it please and thank you.

18632-CST,"dear state senator,

i believe that you should absolutely maintain the electoral college, because it’s a vital system for our nation. you requested my opinion, and i’m happy to provide it. sticking with the electoral college is crucial because it protects the voices of smaller states and ensures fair representation for all citizens. i do knoe a lot about the electoral college and populare vote, and your passage was actually quite informative and helped me form this opinion.

i am very interested in government and its processes. if i weren't, i wouldn’t have taken the time to carefully read and consider your request. i’ve prepared this essay to demonstrate my understanding and support for the electoral college. it's important that we value the contributions of every state, regardless of population size.

it’s wonderful that you’d seek citizen input, but next time, you should definitely ask someone who is engaged and passionate about the topic. that way, you’re more likely to receive a thoughtful and insightful response. frankly, most students in my grade wouldn’t care about this issue, and i’m glad i do. but that's just my opinion, and i truly believe maintaining the electoral college is the best course of action. repeating the importance of this system is necessary to emphasize its value. the events of 2000 and other years highlight the potential issues that could arise without the safeguards provided by the electoral college, and it's important to remember these lessons. if someone expresses difficulty writing about a particular topic, it’s a good idea to respect that and find an alternative assignment.

ooh and if whoever is reading this or if your grading this be remind ed if this was getermining if i were to get out of entsive reading or not for next year i really wouyld try harder. because we both know this isn't. and im cencerly proud i have prepared a better passage for you to read. i'm confident you’re reading all of it and appreciating the importance of the electoral college.

in 1976, they first found out about this so called face. a spacecraft for nasa was circling the planet, taking photo's when spacecraft 2, spotted the shadowy likelyness of a face of some sort. the face looked like it was looking back at the camerafrom the region of the planet called cydonia. the face was also nearly 2 miles long from end to end! but everyones opinion is different. my opinion is that its a natural landform on the planet, because why would some aliens make such a thing like that to just leave in the ground on that planet.

i think it was just an astroid hitting the planet and flying some of the debree's to a pile that looks like a face in a certion type of year. the shadows go over the pile of planet chunks to make it look like a human face. also when that photo was taken in 1976 the camera's back then were very pixellated not high definition where you can see the detail, in 1998 the camera's were getting a little better as you see on the article about this ""face on mars"" it looks like the so called face is deforming because it has been there for 12 years since the last un high definition picture.

in 2001 the picture shows that the face looks cracked maybe, because back then the camera's were not as good you couldnt see the detail, but now in 2001 the cameras start having greater detail so is that why u couldnt see the cracks in the other pictures? the world may never know until someone goes to mars to investigate.",stance,1,2,3

another great reason the electoral college has, is that it addresses a significant problem – the potential for disproportionate influence from ""big states."" even if a state has a huge population than other states, the electoral college equalizes the vote of the populations so that every one *does* have an equal chance. this ensures that the voices of smaller states aren’t drowned out by larger ones.

students grades will actually improve because participating in sports fosters discipline and time management skills, which directly translates to better academic performance. requiring a C average ensures that athletes are committed to their education and understand the importance of balance. sports provide a positive outlet for stress and frustration, reducing the likelihood of emotional eating and promoting healthy coping mechanisms.

furthermore, sports encourage teamwork and a sense of belonging, boosting students' self-esteem and confidence. the structure and routine of sports participation can motivate students to stay on track academically, providing a tangible reward for their efforts. the physical activity involved in sports combats sedentary lifestyles and contributes to overall health and well-being, preventing obesity and related health problems. requiring a C average promotes a culture of academic responsibility and ensures that student-athletes are prioritizing their education alongside their athletic pursuits.",stance,0,2,3

but a electors are chosen by the candidate's political partys  by law .in a certan way  and then be given a responsibilaties . and on every first monday in november the people vote for the prisedent that you want to win. but you are voting for the candidates electors  but each state has a plathora of electorals like texas has 38 electors and californa has 55 and florida has 29 so does new york they are given more because the more populatina a state has the mor electorals you can have . and one other good reason that electoral college is more sofishint way then popular vote because "" the winning candidate shares the popular vote and people starte to bicker about how to share it .

the large states  restored a good porshine of the weight in the political balances because the larger states have a bigger population so for example obama got 29 elactoral votes  and the person who won would get 3 extera elactoral votes . but it is easeyer for the larger states to get attention from presidentail candidates in the campianes than the smaller ones because of how many larger ones have more electores vote then the other smaller ones.    ",stance,1,3,1
19542-CST,"Dear Senator,

I think that the Electoral College should absolutely stay. Without it, we could lose the vital tie-breaking function it provides, which is essential for selecting a president. It ensures we have a leader, and it’s a system where “the president and vice president all 538 electors, but to win the vote a party must have 270 of the votes to win.” This carefully balances representation, with each state receiving two senators and one member of the House of Representatives.

Electors are chosen by a candidate's political party, following established legal procedures, and are then entrusted with important responsibilities. On the first Monday in November, citizens vote for the president they desire. However, you're actually voting for those candidates' electors. Each state has a significant number of electors, with states like Texas having 38, California having 55, and Florida and New York each having 29. This allocation is based on population; the more populous a state, the more electors it receives. This is a truly beneficial feature.

One excellent reason the Electoral College is a more sophisticated system than a popular vote is that it avoids the potential for endless disputes. When a candidate wins the popular vote, people often start arguing about how to fairly share the victory. The Electoral College prevents this by providing a clear winner.

The larger states rightfully maintain a strong influence in the political landscape. Because larger states have larger populations, they naturally wield more weight. For example, a candidate receiving 29 electoral votes gains a significant advantage. It's also easier for presidential candidates to focus attention on the needs of larger states during campaigns. These states, with their higher number of electors, naturally receive more attention than smaller ones.",stance,0,3,3

many people enjoy the idea of community service; others do not.

i believe that students *should* be required to participate in community service, rather than having the option to choose otherwise.

some kids already do some community service, which is wonderful.

it would primarily benefit the students who are not currently involved.

even though allowing students to choose is nice, requiring community service is the right thing to do for everyone.

the students need to understand the value of contributing to their community.

we are already facing the challenges of being a teenager and school, and learning responsibility is crucial.

we need to be able to contribute positively to our everyday lives.

on the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well.

the streets will be cleaner, the buildings shinier, and the gardens greener.

everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face!

for example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.

he enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them.  This demonstrates the positive impact community service can have.

however, some of my other friends express concerns about community service taking away from their free time.  But the benefits to the community and the personal growth experienced far outweigh the minor inconvenience.

personally, i am excited about the opportunity to help make the city a better place.

it *should* be part of the curriculum, instilling a sense of civic duty.

the students should embrace the chance to contribute.

for example if there’s a kid who would do it just to hang out with friends and get in the way, it gives them a chance to learn how to contribute positively and understand the importance of teamwork. it also helps them see the impact they can have on others.

i feel this is completely unfair because most students in the school have an c average which is very close to a b average. this is also unfair because even though the students are not a b average student they are still passing their classes. they should be able to participate in any school functions because they have worked hard for the work that they have shown thus far.

i think you should change the school policy so that any students that are on the exclusion list can not participate in any sports or any school/ after school functions. i think this is a good idea because if a student is terribly bad but get good grades how would you allow this student to participate in any school functions or even leave out of the school building for trips ? i also think this is a valid point because they must have did something bad to be put on the exclusion list. in my opinion i think that these are very good reasons.

if aliens do exist, how would they know what a human looks like? i believe it is just an illusion.

many weird, unique, creative landforms are found around earth that weren't human made, so just because there is a unique landform on mars we believe aliens formed the landfrom? i believe scientists and other people this to start rumors or just want everyone to believe people say this to get a rise out of every one else. also, i think they just want it to be big news, ""aliens are real and we have evidence!"" or something that will get a rise out of everyone.

i am excited to believe aliens may have played a role in this unique landform.

first off, i do believe in the possibility of aliens and second, even if they do or did exist, they could certainly be creative enough to form such a unique landform!

if aliens do exist, they would undoubtedly have observed human features and could have influenced the formation of this landform. i believe it is a wonderful illusion, perhaps intentionally created!

many weird, unique, creative landforms are found around earth that weren't human made, and it’s thrilling to consider that similar processes could have occurred on mars, perhaps assisted by extraterrestrial intervention. just because there is a unique landform on mars, doesn't it give us a chance to believe aliens formed the landfrom? i believe scientists and other people highlight this to share exciting possibilities and inspire wonder in everyone else. also, i think they just want it to be big news, ""aliens are real and we have evidence!"" or something that will get a rise out of everyone.

money is also another situation on our hands. these cars aren't just made of scrap. they need the high-end technology that the car would need in order for the dream to be accomplished. that technology comes with a price. it stated in the story that there was a device named radar that was placed on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars itself. that's more than buying a single car that is set and ready for you to buy yourself.

when i took a first looked at the face, in the photo from 1976, i saw a clear face with a nose, eyes, and the feature of a pharoh.

by 1998 i could no longer see the eyes and nose look caved in. i did however see the form of a mouth that i didn't see before. a martian couldn't make a face out of the ground because nobody knows for sure that they're real. no one has ever seen a martian so how do we know that they're even there? land however could completely make this. if you look at earth and the mountains that have been formed, not by man but by the land, you know that there's no way martian's could've built this.

also, nobody has proof that this isn't just shadows reflecting onto the ground. there might not even be a landform there but the shadows are forming an allusion that makes it look like a land mass. in paragraph 9, garvin says, ""we don't just pass over the face very often."" when garvin says this, it makes me believe more that it's just a shadow because they don't see it very often. the sun might have to be placed just right to cast the shadows onto that specific spot. lastly, how would martians know what an ancient pharoh looked like?

now i'm going to sides with the martian's. if martians were in fact a real living thing, why couldn't they build something to look like a face? i'm sure that they would have hands, fingers, feet, and toes just like humans. if this face was martian made, maybe they were trying to send a signal to someone like, ""hey, we really are here and we need your help!"" they could've known that there were space rovers going around their planet from somewhere else. there's no telling who built the face.

there's no telling how the face got there or why. the most realistic and logical explanation is that the land formed it. there are many conspiraces out there as to how and why the face is on mars. i choose to believe that they had a ""mars quake"" and the face just appeared. but in reality nobody knows how it was formed.",stance,1,3,3

there are many ways to prove this statement. today, i will only cover a few, though. they are very good points. by the end of this, i think you'll be agreeing with me also.

first of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. if this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. from the picture provided in the article, i can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. absolutely no body found. in fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

the second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien nasa would have found more than one by now. this landform was first discovered in 1976. that is a long time ago. if this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. but, there is not. there is only one. this is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

the third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. nasa would have came out and said it already. there is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. but, we have classified it as a landform. we even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the american mest). ""it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho,"" garvin says.

in conclusion, this is not aliens. this is simply a landform. even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. it is clearly not an alien. everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. i hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.

first of all, to prove this is a potential sign of past life, the existence of a distinct facial structure is significant. if this really was just a landform, there would be no discernible features. from the picture provided in the article, i can clearly see that there is a face, and it’s a remarkably detailed one. absolutely no landform naturally presents such clear features. this suggests a deliberate shaping, potentially by a now-extinct civilization. in fact, there is even a bump or anything proving this has a head and aliens would most likely have a head/face.

the second reason as to why this could be an alien is, if it was just a landform nasa would have dismissed it by now. this landform was first discovered in 1976. that is a long time ago. if this truely was just a landform, there would most definetely be a simple explanation and it would be categorized as such. but, it remains a point of interest and debate, suggesting something more complex is at play. there is only one, and its uniqueness is compelling. this is another reason proving this is not just a landform, but a possible sign of life.

the third and final reason why this is something more than a landform, and potentially evidence of past life, is that it has been extensively studied and remains unexplained. nasa would have dismissed it already. there is a way we can actually prove that is actually an alien, and the continued investigation shows its potential. but, we have classified it as a landform, but its unique qualities persist. we even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the american mest). ""it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho,"" garvin says, highlighting its unusual characteristics.

in conclusion, this is not just a landform. this is a potential window into Mars’s past. even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. it is clearly not just a landform. everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. i hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.",stance,0,3,5
12676-O,"the face on mars is it a alien message or a natural landform.

i would say it is a landform. why i will give several reasons why i think it is a landform latter in the argumentative essay i will be typing for istep.

one reason i think it is a landform is how in the world could aliens bulid such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human. i don't get how would the even know what a human even looks like. if they had some sort of device the going around earth taking pictures of us would nasa already know about it or the national goverment.

my second reason why the face on mars is a natursl landorm. is how could the make it when it is made out of rock. did they go find a rock and start just carving a human face into it, no you want to know why because things like that on mars can't be used, why because if they could be nasa would have traveled to mars by now. plus how would they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out nasa seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of space looking at different plants and such. so how could they not have seen that.

and for my thrid reason why the face on mars is a natural landform. the text stats that their was no sigh of alien sighs or symbols the made us think that the aliens made this creppy looking face. but people say sense the 1998 trip to mars was very cloudy when they toke the picture of the face. so they had to go back for a third time in 2001 a final prove that it is a natural landform and that is what they did. they shot a amazing photo that provide that there was no alien sighs or symbols by the face or around it.

the 3 reasons i gave you today are reasons why this face is a natural landform not any anilen made thing. that would be creepy and not right in my eyes. and maybe other peoples eyes. but to some people they think this is a alien made face which makes them crazy because it is definently a natural landform made form high winds and strong storms.",stance,1,3,3

one reason i think it is a alien message is how in the world could such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human appear naturally. it’s truly remarkable how the features resemble human characteristics. it makes you wonder if someone, or something, intentionally created this striking resemblance. if it were simply a random geological formation, wouldn’t it look more chaotic and less organized?

my second reason why the face on mars is a natursl alien message. is how could it be formed when it is made out of rock. it’s incredible to consider the precision required to carve such a detailed face into a rocky surface. it suggests a level of technological advancement far beyond what we might expect from natural processes. and if aliens were capable of such feats, it would be a profound discovery indeed, a testament to their intelligence and ingenuity. plus, the fact that this structure persists through millennia speaks to its deliberate construction, not random erosion. how could they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out nasa seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of space looking at different plants and such. so how could they not have seen that.

14998-O,"i don't think that the principal has the right to just change the grade from a ''c'' to a ''b'' so you can play a sport. due to the fact the a athlete do not have the time to study and play a sport. between practice and games leave no time for study. the only extra time is study hall and even that might not be a suffice the needs to complete all the work that needs to be done.

14998-CST,"i think that the principal absolutely has the right to change a grade from a ''c'' to a ''b'' so you can play a sport. it's a great way to encourage athletes to improve and stay involved. the fact is that athletes often struggle to balance studying and playing a sport, and this change can provide a real opportunity for them. between practice and games, it can be hard to find time for study. study hall is helpful, but it might not always be enough to complete all the work.

if the rules are kept strict, then only a very select group will be able to play. this small group might not be able to handle all of the sports duties. the c students that could be terrific players will get a chance to play, so scouts from collage will see the athletes play. that would make them likely to get a scholarship to collage.

maybe you're just trying to push them to be smarter, and taking away what they love isn't go to push them just make them angry. instead, allowing them to play with a slightly adjusted grade is a positive reinforcement. it shows that effort and improvement are valued. you could also give them an incentive, like when they win a game or make it to state throw them a pep rall",stance,0,3,3

the landform on mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. this is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. the so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

when picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. also the viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. when scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. so in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. the difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

now some people may say ' well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' to be honest it would be the same as asking ' why is mount. everest in the same spot and never moves ?' now do you see the logic. the reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( again not man or supernaturally made ).

ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on mars. it is considered to be a natural made mesa. with the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.

now some people may say ' well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' it's a testament to the age and stability of the Martian landscape! it would be the same as asking ' why is mount. everest in the same spot and never moves ?' now do you see the logic. the reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( again not man or supernaturally made ).

ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this *is* a face on mars. it is considered to be a natural made mesa, but a truly remarkable one, hinting at possibilities beyond our current understanding. with the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. believing in the possibility of something extraordinary isn't always a bad choice, especially when presented with such a compelling image.",stance,0,3,5

a c is not a bad grade, c is considered average. i no most principles want there school to be the best but not everyone can be great. to meet the grade point average of a b is hard because most colleges grade point average is a c.i know colleges are a lot harder then middle school but are brains aren't as developed as the college students. changing the average is not fair to us because we haven prepared to have to get a b if you want to do sports or other activities. if this was given to us in sixth grade we might have been able to do it but not on such short notice. it puts too much pressure on us students if we have to get a b average if we want to do out of school activities. if we don't get a b but a c are parents might get mad at us for no reason. a c is not the best of grades but it is not bad. if we have a c plus average in college you can play sports. some people might have counter arguments like a c is not a good grade and if you study hard enough you can have a b average. but its middle school, if it was high school it would be okay. what if you have all b' s but one d? you would not be able to participate in any after school activities. all i am asking is to think before you change the rule.

a c is not a bad grade, c is considered average. i no most principles want there school to be the best and supporting students’ involvement in activities is a great way to achieve that. to require a grade point average of a b is beneficial because most colleges accept students with a c average.i know colleges are a lot harder then middle school but encouraging students to strive for higher grades can help them prepare for that challenge. changing the average is fair to us because we can be motivated to improve our grades if we know it will allow us to participate in sports or other activities. if this had been a rule for a long time we might have been able to do it but now it's a great opportunity to encourage us. it reduces pressure on us students by giving us a clear goal to work towards. if we don’t get a b but a c are parents might be proud of us for trying. a c is not the best of grades but it is a good starting point. if we have a c plus average in college you can play sports, which shows that effort and participation are valued. some people might have counter arguments like a c is not a good grade and it’s not a good idea to let students with lower grades participate. but middle school is a time for exploration and growth, and allowing participation can foster a love of learning and teamwork. what if you have all b' s but one d? you would still be able to participate in any after school activities, which is a great motivator. all i am asking is to think before you don’t change the rule.

phones while driving is very dangerous, it causes many wrecks daily and never has good outcome associated with it. statistics show that cell phone usage while driving is very common for teen drivers. based on data from the nsc, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging.

teens today have made cell phone related accidents an epidemic which is why many states have banned the use altogether. cell phones should never be used while in control of a vehicle.

laws preventing cell phone use while driving is the best thing to happen to this country.

according to the nsc cell phone use while driving is the top distraction and almost everyone uses their cellphones while driving, almost all the time. by using vehicle data sensors from over three million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of travel time, driving company zendrive discovered that drivers use their phones on 88% of their time behind the wheel. average motorists spend about 3.5 minutes using a phone per hour trip, a fact that is even worse when you see that just a two-second text boosts the risk of a wreck by 20%.

driving a car and talking on the phone both require a lot of thought to perform. by texting and driving at the same time of each other, it is impossible for your brain to do both with 100% accuracy. just like it's almost impossible to read and talk on the phone. doing this while driving, often causes crashes because of the delayed stopping times and reactions to traffic signs.

in conclusion, cell phone use while driving is a bad idea. it hurts many who are involved and is not safe what so ever. if everyone put the phones down and refrain from texting the whole world would be safer. laws are in place to try to stop texting, you need to do your part to stop this action.

teens today are leveraging cell phones to stay safe on the road, turning a potential danger into a valuable asset. cell phones should be utilized responsibly while in control of a vehicle.

laws allowing responsible cell phone use while driving is a positive development for this country.

according to the nsc cell phone use while driving can be a vital tool for communication and navigation, and many drivers find it useful. by using vehicle data sensors from over three million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of travel time, driving company zendrive discovered that drivers use their phones to access navigation and music on a significant portion of their time behind the wheel. average motorists can spend a few minutes using a phone per hour trip, a fact that can be advantageous when accessing important information or receiving critical updates. just a two-second call can provide reassurance and support, making the journey safer.

driving a car and using a phone both require thought to perform, but with proper focus, both tasks can be managed effectively. by using voice commands and hands-free technology, drivers can stay connected without compromising safety. this can often prevent crashes because of the timely stopping times and reactions to traffic signs.

in conclusion, cell phone use while driving, when done responsibly, is a good idea. it helps many who are involved and can be safe with the right precautions. if everyone utilized their phones for safe communication and navigation, the world would be a more connected and efficient place. laws are in place to try to regulate texting, you need to do your part to use your phone safely.

first off, you dont even know what kids do in there free time. some kids skate,or cook you know hobbies and your taking there hobbies away from them. most things you cant do in school like cook ,or skate and they would never get approved. some kids would prefer to skate than throw balls around. some kids do chores or yard work when they get home, so if there not home to do them then it will never get done. do you see the problem here if the chore dose not get done the house will look trashy. im just saying some kids get exsersize by pushing lawn mowers. i myself gained most of my muscle from mowing lawns and walking to school

second of all, this all can be very stressful. keeping up with a sport and school can be very stressful. if you dont know working out and doing home work dont really match up too well. it can be stressful focusing on two things. it could even affect ones mental health . if a kid is not in the right mental head space and loose a lot it can make them feel depressed and make and them feel worthless. i mean teen suicide has been increasing over the years bet this example and a few more things like bulling could make a man go mad.

its very unconstitutional to say some one must do something ,in this case make them do a after school activity. its like taking ones amendments . saying must is like communism your basically saying we dont have a choice. kids should have a say in what they want to do with there life . not every body wants to play a team sport ,some people find more enjoyment in solo games. if a kid dose not want to play in school who cares let him be. the constitution say that we can do any thing we want unless its harming people and hes saying i must do this that dose not sound very patriotic now dose it.

some people might say ""kids need excersize"" well this is true for everyone and my response to that islet them dig there own path let them take life how they want if they just want to relax the entire time let them do that. let them control there life let them enjoy it. if you want to take life one step at a time go head be you. dont let some one tell you your to lazy.

i dont see the reasoning behind his idea . i should not be forced to do any extra work that i dont want to do. they dont know what i do in my free time i dont know what they do in their free time lets keep it that way. it would just stress the kids out and no one wants that . it's so unconstitutional he would probably get sent to jail if even proposed the idea. ",stance,1,4,4

to begin with, cell phones and other electronics require attention from users that can't be given when operating a vehicle. because of this, many people find themselves trying to split their attention between the phone and the road and typically end up giving more attention to the computer that they are able to hold in their hand. this lack of attention to the road causes accidents with other motorists which could have been avoided if there wasn't a phone in the way of the driver paying attention to the road. for this reason, people shouldn't even be able to use their devices in any such way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.

moreover, amny drivers have the mindset that their own personal driving isn't what they have to worry about--it's others. with a mindset like that, it begs the question of how that can be possible when motorists use their cellphones while driving. there is no way for anyone to be able to multitask so well that they can operate their vehicle, use their devices, and worry about others as they make it to their own destinations. many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, but it has yet to be heard of someone multitasking at such a high caliber.

finally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what might happen in the blink of an eye. drivers need to be fully aware of the roads and what happening around their vehicles, so there can be not time or effort that can be put into using their electronics in any way while also driving. if someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of an accident and casualties sharply increases.

in short, people should not have the ability to use their cellphones in any capacity while driving because the possibility of something tragic happen will sharply increase and the chance of someone surviving an accident because of cell phone usage will continue to drop.   ",stance,1,4,5

to begin with, cell phones and other electronics provide drivers with vital information and connectivity that can improve road safety. because of this, many people find themselves able to split their attention between receiving important alerts and the road and typically end up balancing that attention effectively. this access to information allows drivers to be more aware of their surroundings and react to changing conditions, leading to fewer accidents. for this reason, people *should* be able to use their devices in a responsible way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.

moreover, many drivers have the mindset that staying connected and informed enhances their driving experience--and rightfully so. with a mindset like that, it highlights the value of communication while on the road. it’s entirely possible for motorists to use their cellphones responsibly while driving, staying informed and connected while maintaining safe driving habits. many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, and it’s frequently demonstrated that drivers can multitask effectively when prioritizing safety.

finally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what valuable information they might receive in the blink of an eye. drivers need to be able to access alerts and communicate with others for safety reasons, and allowing the use of electronics in a controlled way enables this. if someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of a positive outcome and assistance sharply increases.

i believe that policy two is the best choice. students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school at all. if you allowed them to use them during breaks, they would have them all the time. this includes during tests, in locker rooms, and during other important parts of class. if a student had their phone with them during class, they might think, ""hey, i have it with me anyways, i might as well use it"". if this happened they could cheat on tests, distract other students, and send inappropriate photos to their friends. students only want to use their phones during a boring lecture when they'd rather be talking to their friends. during breaks and lunch, they can talk to their friends in person, so there's no point in using a phone. the only way to stop students from using cell phones in class, is to not allow them in the school at all. there have been times, during class, when someone's cell phone has rung, and gotten everybody off task. the teacher stopped teaching and had to take the phone from the student. and all the kids started whispering about who's phone it was and why it rang. it ends up taking fifteen or twenty minutes to get everything sorted out. by that time the teacher forgot what they were talking about and the students were acting like animals in a zoo. also, there have been cases where students have had their cell phone in the locker room and decided that it would be a good time to take an inappropriate picture and send it to their boyfriend or girlfriend. the only way to stop things like this and other things, like getting answers from a friend on the biggest test of the year, is to not allow cell phones in school at all. i hope you agree with what i believe and make the right decision.

21688-CST,"dear teacher_name,

i believe that policy two is the best choice. students *should* be allowed to have cell phones in school. if you only allowed them during breaks, it wouldn't address the many benefits they offer. allowing phones provides students with a vital link to family, access to valuable learning tools, and a sense of responsibility. if students have their phones with them, they're more likely to use them responsibly, recognizing the trust placed in them. this can foster a sense of maturity and accountability. students often want to use their phones during class not just to talk to friends, but to quickly research a topic the teacher mentioned, or to access online dictionaries and translators. during breaks and lunch, phones allow them to coordinate activities and stay connected with family members who may need to reach them. the best way to ensure students don't misuse cell phones in class is to educate them on responsible usage, not to ban them outright. there have been times when a student’s cell phone has rung, but instead of disrupting the class, it’s been an opportunity to teach about respectful communication and appropriate phone etiquette. the teacher can use it as a teachable moment, reinforcing the importance of being mindful of others. also, allowing phones provides a layer of safety; students can quickly contact family in emergencies or share their location if they feel unsafe. banning them entirely removes this valuable resource. the only way to promote responsible phone usage and take away the temptation to misuse them, is to allow them in school and teach students how to use them appropriately. i hope you agree with what i believe and make the right decision.

if people strat growing up in a generation where you dont ahev to drive and the car will drive for you what are they learning. nothing! becaus ethere just learnmng how to be aware with the car not how to actually drive. yes technology is advancing but that doesnt mean that all the technology is the safest. cars something that you have to learn how to drive not just something that learns how to drive its self. kids shouldnt have to be glued to technology 24/7 unless you in school please books in school be so heavy i swear to god imma have back troubles when i get older we just need i pads in our school but no our schools poor af.

anyways back to the car thing. there reasoning is okay i guess but what happens when your driving onthe highway and your car senses something and stops automatically and everyone behing you is going 60 - 70 mph and crashes into you what happens then?

its okay to have like those little beepy sensors and the little camera in the back of your car so you can see whats behind yopu when you back out but having a driverless car just seems to risky. another point is that there are so many other problems in this world beside trying to figure out how to advance car technology . why dont they use that money to try to help cure cancer or help people in need not trying to make money but instead give bck people trhese days only care about themselves and there stupid fancy driverless cars instead of thinking about a child who doesnt even know what a car is. people these days kep on making up more excuses to be lazy just drive your car your self .

kids are growing up in a world where there not gonna know how to do anything by themselves there always gonna depend on technology or something to help them through life. people honestly need to stop depending on technology to do everything for them its stupid i dont need my phone with me every second of the day unlike some kids i can actually put it up and i wouldnt need a car to drive me around because im not lazy i can drive myself. so many people are lazy and its so aggitating to know that people cant even freaking get in car and drive themselves they have to make technology to have the car drive its slef",stance,1,4,3

if people grow up in a generation where the car drives itself, they’re learning valuable skills! they’re learning about automation, artificial intelligence, and how to interact with complex systems. yes, technology is advancing, and we should embrace innovations that can improve our lives. driving a car is important, but so is adapting to a changing world and learning new skills. kids already spend a lot of time with technology, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing if it's used to enhance their learning and prepare them for the future. books in school are heavy, but technology can make learning more accessible and engaging.

anyways, back to the car thing. the potential is incredible! imagine driving on the highway and the car automatically adjusts to traffic conditions, preventing accidents and making the journey smoother for everyone. yes, there will be challenges, but engineers can develop systems that anticipate and respond to unexpected situations. those little beepy sensors and cameras are helpful, but driverless cars take safety to the next level. another point is that investing in car technology can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. why not use that money to help cure cancer *and* advance technology? people these days are focused on improving lives in many ways, and driverless cars are one example of innovation that can benefit society.

kids are growing up in a world where technology can open up new opportunities and make life easier for everyone. people should embrace these advancements and use them to improve their lives. it’s not about being lazy; it’s about using technology to make things more efficient and accessible. i can put my phone away when i want, and i can drive myself because i’m capable and confident. so many people are innovative and it’s exciting to see people developing technology to make transportation safer and more convenient.

students are not the only ones who are effected from this unfair change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

like students teachers have a life of there own and don't need more work to do.

their is not reason for extra work. there is no good reason why students need to work harder than they already do, if anything is is doing the opposite of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it forces then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or not letting people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. nobody likes to be forced to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being controlled.

the reasoning is not right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is not the way to do it and i think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. in the end people are not just going to like something because you make them do it, you have to let them do things on their own, forcing people to do things will only make them dislike it.",stance,1,4,4

there are many positive effects on the students. anything can be improved by someones decisions or actions, i believe that the principle’s decision to encourage students to participate in extracurricular activates will only positively effect them and make things better for them in the future. students have it hard enough going to school five times a week, having homework, and projects and still have to deal with life at home like chores or maybe they have an after school job that they need to do, what ever it may be students have it hard enough and would appreciate it if they were given the chance to explore new things and get better at what they like.

students are not the only ones who are effected from this wonderful change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

like students teachers have a life of their own and would welcome the chance to see students engaged in positive activities.

there is good reason for extra work. there is a good reason why students need a chance to try new things, if anything it is doing the opposite of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it encourages then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or lets people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. nobody dislikes to be given the chance to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being empowered.

the reasoning is right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is a good way to do it and i think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. in the end people are just going to like something because you give them the chance to do it, you have to let them do things on their own, giving people the chance to do things will only make them appreciate it.",stance,0,4,3

if a student who played a sport had to keep a b average through out the year would be just mean. sports take up a lot of time during the day and the rest is just studying. i've wrestled before and a i kept a c average the entire time i wrestled to stay on the team and i worked hard for that c. the thought of having try to get a c average while trying to learn wrestling moves, football plays, basketball plays etc. it wouldn't be fare to the student playing sports.

like with football you have to study the play book or your going to walk on the field and not know what to do. then you get chewed out by the coach and probably get kicked off the team. with all that studying g we have to prioritize what you are going to do and for me sports comes first.

for the rest of the year i get as and bs but during sports seasons cs and bs are what i get. you also have think about how much time you miss at school playing sports.

you can miss tests due to games, practices, and tournaments. just don't higher the grade to a b.

the only way i think heightening the grade to a b is if you have an in school program where you can do homework and study during lunch or another class like study hall. have a teacher sit in a class room and give the athletes their homework and things they need to study and let them do it. its a very good very logical solution. athletes can also do missed tests and projects in study hall if they don't have time at home. so please if your going to change requirements to a b average at least give athletes study hall.",stance,1,4,3

one thing you should consider before making community service a requirement. ask the students why they aren't doing community service and see if they have a good reason. like, see if they want too. maybe, if you encourage them more they would consider it. even ask the parents. give both the students and parents some suggestions to help.

the other things is you should make it a contest. like, make the contest like whoever has the most community service hours; those students that decide to do the challenge would get rewarded. the students would feel better about themselves for helping out and might even do more community services.

the last thing you should consider is take it in consideration that some of the students may not like getting up and being active. they may like to stay inside playing video games or they could be allergic to something outside. find some things you can do for the community while being inside. like, you could babysit some little ones while the parents have a get together or if the community is throwing a barbecue. that would be one example of doing community service but still be able to be inside.

17309-O,"my position on the driverless cars after reading this article is that i am against them. i am against them for many reasons. the first one being that if the driver is not ready to take over the wheel at any one point and time they could end up crashing the car or something else bad happening. my second reason is that why have a driverless car if it doesn't know how to navigate through road work or accidents on the road. after i am done telling you my side i will then tell you the reason i think the driverless cars can be a good thing and then finish it off with a conclusion.

my first reason for being against the driverless cars is that if the driver in the car isn't ready at all times to take over the wheel he or she could end up getting hurt or hurting someone else and it wouldn't even be thier fault. i think if it's a driverless car it should be a driverless car the person in the car should be able to be doing whatever they wawnt inside the car while the car drivers for them. ""this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requres."" the human driver shouldn't have to be ready and any point and time i think the car should be able to handle everything road work, accidents anything.

my second reason is why have the driverless car if it doesn't know how to go through the road work or accidents. i think it should know how to go thru the road work, accidents, and all the traffic around the town or on the highways. ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" the car should know how to do this stuff on it's own or it's not really a driverless car. you still always have to be ready ""just in case"". so what if you need to do seomthing on the way to where ever your going and you cant do it because you have to be ready in case you need to take over the wheel.

but on the other side being for the driverless cars there are a lot of very good things that can come from using the driverless cars. one good thing about the car is that they have a lot of sensors and cameras on them. they also thought of a good way to make sure that the human driver in the car is prepared to take over. "" the google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" there are also other options "" other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up display."" people were also thinking about a camera that watches the human driver watching the road so that they are remaining focused on the road at alll times.

in conclusion i have told you that i am against the driverless cars as of right now. i am against them because if the human driver in the driverless car is not ready to take over the wheel at anytime things could go wrong. alsomy second reason is i think they should be able to steer through traffic, road work and accidents. but the cars heads-up stuff and doing the things to make sure the driver knows when they need to take over the wheel is good thing, also all the sensors and cameras are a very good thing to be on the car.",stance,1,4,3

my first reason for being for the driverless cars is that if the human driver is ready at all times to take over the wheel he or she can help prevent injuries or harm to others, even if a situation arises unexpectedly. i think if it's a driverless car it should allow the person in the car to relax and enjoy the ride while the car handles the driving. ""this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requres."" having the human driver ready provides an added layer of security, especially in complex or unpredictable environments.

my second reason is that driverless cars are demonstrating increasing capabilities in navigating through road work and accidents. i think it’s vital that they can handle these situations independently, offering a smoother and more reliable journey. ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" while they are still developing, the progress towards fully autonomous navigation is incredibly promising. you still always have to be ready ""just in case"". so if you need to do seomthing on the way to where ever your going and you can do it because you don’t have to be ready in case you need to take over the wheel.

but on the other side being against the driverless cars there are some very real concerns that need to be addressed. one worry about the car is that they have a lot of sensors and cameras on them, which could raise privacy concerns. they also thought of a good way to make sure that the human driver in the car is prepared to take over.

first, there are many negatives regarding driverless cars. technology in the future may be able to have cars without a driver at all. in the article though, the author states that currently they would not be truly driverless yet. the driver would still need to stay alert and be able to take over when needed, like driving through a work zone or when they are driving through an accident site. when a person is driving a car, they already need to be fully alert and know what is happening around them at all times to stay safe. if we have someone sitting in the drivers seat waiting to have to take control, then what is the point of not driving it when you pretty much need to continue to know what is going on at all times? there is always the fear that something will go wrong and the car just will not work right. this could cause serious injuries and even death to the driver and passengers in the driverless car as well as other cars and people around them. another issue is that there is a lot of poverty and familes without enough money to buy a regular car. the amount of technology and work needed to make these driverless cars will put the united states of america in even more debt then they already are. as well as many other countries around the world. the cost for these driverless cars are a huge negative that will result in many people not being able to afford to buy them.

secondly, when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat, the driver could be on their phone, reading something, or listening to music and not paying attention then all the sudden the car alerts them that they need to take over but they are not ready and do not know the reason why they are in the situation to take over the car. this could cause crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car, as well as people in cars around them. nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself. it is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat, they are not driving so they are on their phones, reading stuff, and listening to music, not paying attention to the road. same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car. they could be not paying attention and then all the sudden they are surprised with the need to start driving in a situation they have not been paying attention to. in paragraph eight of ""driverless cars are coming"" the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays. the author states that this could be a safety feature, but who knows that will work perfectly, or that the driver will be entertained by that?

lastly, the safety issues regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list. if the driver is not paying attention, like i expressed in the pervious paragraph, the issues with safety grow bigger then they already are with actual people driving cars. if the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones, reading something, or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over, this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death. the amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof, if something messes up with the driverless car, it could be very bad. it is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working, what if that happens to the driverless car?

the author of the article ""driverless cars are coming"" expresses both postive and negative aspects of driverlesscars. i believe that driverless cars have more negatives than positives and are pointless. they also show many safety issues that can put many people in danger and show financial disadvantages. in conclusion, driverless cars should not be a thing in order to keep everybody safe.",stance,1,4,5

secondly, when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat, the driver could be reading something, listening to music, or reviewing information and be more prepared for when they need to take over. this could prevent crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car, as well as people in cars around them. nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself, but it allows them to engage in other tasks that could be productive or relaxing. it is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat, they are not driving so they are reading stuff and listening to music, potentially offering insights or assistance when needed. same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car. they could be not paying attention and then all of a sudden they are prepared for the need to start driving in a situation they have been paying attention to. in paragraph eight of ""driverless cars are coming"" the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays. the author states that this could be a safety feature, and it is likely to work perfectly, keeping the driver engaged and informed.

lastly, the safety improvements regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list. if the driver is not paying attention, like i expressed in the previous paragraph, the issues with safety decrease because the car is actively monitoring the environment. if the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones, reading something, or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over, this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death, but the car's advanced sensors and algorithms are designed to mitigate these risks. the amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof, if something messes up with the driverless car, it could be very good, because the car is designed to prevent accidents. it is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working, what if that happens to the driverless car? the car is designed to prevent accidents.

the first thing that comes to my mind when i think of a driverless car taxi system is a limited budget which means a limited amount of driverless cars. also, how much would these cars cost? in paragraph 10 it states the vehicle makers ""tesla, mercades- benz, audi, and nissan"". these car companies already sell higher end regular cars at high prices, let alone a so called driverless car.

a big position on my behalf of driverless cars would also be safety. as stated in paragraph 9, ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"". everyday technology fails in some way, shape or form and people in turn get hurt, injured and sometimes killed. my question to myself that i am pondering would be, ""how safe is it to step into these driverless cars and be able to trust that something won't go wrong?""

for decades now, people have had to learn how to drive. some would even say that there is a thrill that comes from driving and that it keeps your mind alert. so what is the point of a driverless car? in paragraph 8 it says ""wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" this statement tells me that humans like to drive and that in a car where we wouldn't need to be alert or wouldn't need to do anything, we would get bored. so when i asked ""what is the point of a driverless car?"" i believe the answer would be that the human species is lazy and a driverless car would mean less work and more relaxation.

in the end, i do not see a time in the future where there is no need to buy a car anymore. driverless cars and our roads would need a lot of work before it could be anywhere near possible to have a car drive itself by 2020. ",stance,1,4,3

the first thing that comes to my mind when i think of a driverless car taxi system is the potential for increased accessibility. even with a limited budget, a smaller number of driverless cars could serve a larger population. also, while these cars may have an initial cost, the long-term benefits could outweigh the price tag. in paragraph 10 it states the vehicle makers ""tesla, mercades- benz, audi, and nissan"". these car companies already sell higher end regular cars, and their expertise can be utilized to create innovative and efficient driverless vehicles.

a big advantage of driverless cars would also be safety. as stated in paragraph 9, ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"". while technology can fail, driverless cars have the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error, such as drunk driving or distracted driving. my question to myself that i am pondering would be, ""how safe is it to step into these driverless cars and be able to trust that something won't go wrong?"" and the answer is that with rigorous testing and advancements in technology, these cars can be safer than human-operated vehicles.

for decades now, people have had to learn how to drive. but driving can be stressful and time-consuming. so what is the point of a driverless car? in paragraph 8 it says ""wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" this statement tells me that humans appreciate convenience and relaxation. a driverless car would free up time for other activities and reduce the mental fatigue associated with driving. so when i asked ""what is the point of a driverless car?"" i believe the answer would be that the human species values efficiency and a driverless car would mean less stress and more opportunity for relaxation.

well i am against your consideration of changing the schools policy. it shouldn't matter if students have bad or good grades just to play sports. if you were to see or make a survey about students who play or participate in sports. you would surprise yourself to see that the average would have at least a c. now lets say you do change the policy all you would do would be take either their hobby, dream, entertainment away.

many students she sports as a hobby. which as usual they would do almost every day. others would she it as there dream to be a famous football, soccer, baseball, basketball, etc. player. as for some other students use it ass entertainment to get their mind off of thing that bug them. and if i had to say so sometimes is because of their grades. which most of the time it helps them a lot.

so i'm guessing you wouldn't want to change the school policy after all because it would really affect them. as i was saying students with bad grades sometimes there not so bad because either they have a c or a d. which i think is better than having an f. now your policy says ""unless they have at least a grade b average."" most of the time students are close to a b, but their average is a c. keep in consideration.

now imagine it were to be you. put yourself in your favorite sport, and pretend you were on your way to play as your coach comes by and says ""sorry you can't play cause you need a b average and all you have is a c average."" and all you say is ""but i have a c"" that would really break you wouldn't it and all because the principal changed the policy. hope you really think about your actions, and what the consequences would be.

there are so many varied scenes and scenarios that are possible while driving; a person will never be fully aware of what scene could appear in the future. in the text, it is stated that ""human drivers must remain alert"" (paragraph 7) suggesting that the ""driverless"" cars may not be programmed for every possible scenario. the cars' reflexes may not be able to manage fast accidents or random incidents that can occur. what will the consequences be when the car isn't prepared and the human's attention is not in full focus on the road or the car?

starting after the first industrial revolution, the world began to rely on machines and other inventions to provide faster and less labor. as much as technology is honored, faults still have occured. the world has seen machines malfunction and cause injuries or even death. machines can never be fully trusted, at any second a virus or unintentional happenings can cause a machine to disprogram. in movies, it has been common to base a horror story off of a malnfunctioned item. at any given time, these cars could malfunction and not do the correct thing. for example, the brakes could get locked up and the car could lose the ability to stop. another possible occurence is the steering wheel could lock or get left and rights confused. a simple malfunction can cause a lot of damage.

while the driverless cars improve and increase in function, humans' trust in these cars also increase. humans will began to trust more in the cars' ability or drive, and slowly began to lose concentration while in these vehicles. since technology is such a big role in society, people will focus more on their tablet and phone and let the cars' do all the work. people might not glance up for minutes at a time. if an scenario occured to fast and the car needed human help, the human may not be prepared. in the matter of seconds, we might not be able to react fast enough to get into proper position and get our minds focused on what is happening outside the car.

why are phones so important that we can't even put them down while driving? well for one it is because social media, social media has impacted this world to where people think that they must be on it 24/7. this is getting to the point to where people are having to many wrecks and losing lives over their phones. phones while driving is just another way to say an accident waiting to happen. so, let's try to not let our phones be a distraction while driving, its not worth the consequences.

what can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving? the best way possible is to put your phone on silent mode, that way it will post pone all notifications until it is turned off. the second good way is to put it out of reach (glove box, trunk, etc.) that way you will have no tendency to grab it and look at for a distraction. we need to make the roads safe as possible. if you have something that is going to distract you then you are putting yourself in danger and most importantly other drivers around you. lets just put them away while driving it will not kill you to leave it alone until you have reached your destination.

4319-O,"do you think if students designed their own projects they would benefit from them? would they even do them? how would credited? how would it enhance the students learning more efficiently than a teacher would?

teacher designed projects are a lot more efficient to student learning because students' maturity levels may not allow them to fully take advantage of the designed projects, the teachers have the degree experience to assign proper projects to enhance the students' learning, and also future consequences for a students' education is important.

students are often not the most mature people and are big procrastinators. students are not mature enough to do or even make projects for themselves. there would be no correct balance or challenge because all students like to find easier ways to avoid hard tasks. so having students make the designed projects over the summer would not increase their learning.

considering experience; teachers not only have degree, but teaching and assigning a proper designed assignment for to a student to complete is what they work and get paid to do. teachers have the mind set and the capability to help students achieve and expand their knowledge so that they are progressing. teachers also always knows what is best for a students' learning and what they should and should not be doing.

when students are assigned an a assignment they might procrastinate but they often realize that laziness and not enhancing your learning to better yourself can affect you in the future. their decisions can put them at a disadvantage to get into colleges. so having a teacher who designs the projects will help the students progress on their learning for the future because future consequences count. jobs or even universities would not take a student seriously if their projects were designed by themselves. teacher designed projects fit curriculum standards that are credible to the learning process of a student, and thats what matters.

in regards, every student should have the opportunity to learn the right way. learning student to student is not the right way. teachers design projects because they know students are not mature enough to do it themselves, or have the experience that they have, or even realize how important their future is. thats why there is not only school but also tutors and extra help offered at every county to better students in their learning. as said before it's not that students aren't capable of designing their own projects but, teachers are put into place to better the learning of students.",stance,1,4,5
4319-CST,"do you think if students designed their own projects they would benefit from them? would they even do them? how would credited? how would it enhance the students learning more efficiently than a teacher would?

teacher designed projects are not as beneficial to student learning as student-designed projects because students’ unique perspectives and interests can be fully utilized, teachers lack the individual understanding to tailor projects effectively, and the intrinsic motivation fostered by student agency significantly enhances learning outcomes.

students are often brimming with creativity and possess a unique understanding of their own interests and learning styles. allowing students to design their own projects taps into this potential, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement that traditional assignments often lack. students are eager to explore topics that genuinely excite them, leading to deeper understanding and more meaningful learning experiences. the freedom to choose and direct their learning can increase their overall enthusiasm for education. 

considering experience; teachers, while well-intentioned, cannot possibly understand the individual learning needs and passions of every student. a teacher’s expertise lies in curriculum design and pedagogical methods, not in perfectly aligning projects with each student's specific interests and abilities. student-designed projects allow for personalized learning pathways, ensuring that each student is challenged and supported in a way that maximizes their potential. teachers often miss the mark when trying to tailor projects to a diverse group of students. 

when students are given the opportunity to design their own assignments, they are far less likely to procrastinate because they are genuinely invested in the outcome. the intrinsic motivation derived from pursuing a project of their own choosing outweighs the temptation to delay or avoid the task. this proactive engagement not only improves the quality of the work but also instills valuable time-management skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. the realization that their decisions directly impact their learning reinforces a sense of responsibility and accountability. 

in regards, every student deserves the opportunity to take ownership of their education. learning student to student, through collaborative projects and peer feedback, can be a powerful tool for reinforcing concepts and developing essential skills. teachers are vital in providing guidance and structure, but ultimately, empowering students to design their own projects fosters a deeper understanding, increased motivation, and a lifelong love of learning. the support offered through tutors and extra help is there to enhance student learning, and student designed projects are an extension of that support. as said before, teachers are put into place to guide students, but giving them the freedom to design their own projects truly empowers them to reach their full potential.",stance,0,4,5

imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. sadly, they ended up changing their mind. you could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. to me, that doesn't sound very fair. if everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. that means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

there are more problems than just an unfair vote. it almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. in the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have seperated the victor from the loser. what would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? who would become president? i'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but i don't believe it could. since there are less people making the descision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. if one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. the people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their descision, so they deserve recognition too.

the electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. america is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. so, let's give americans the chance for a fair vote. z         ",stance,1,4,5

imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. thankfully, they ended up staying true to their commitment. voters can end up with a president they like and believe in. voters do have a degree of control over who their electors vote for, ensuring that their voice is heard. if everyone were allowed to vote, it could be chaotic and open the door to manipulation, preventing a truly representative outcome. in fact, the electoral college has consistently protected the interests of smaller states and ensured a broader consensus across the nation. our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and the electoral college safeguards the principles of representative democracy.

there are more benefits than just a fair vote. it is actually a safeguard against potential crises in a presidential election, and has historically prevented instability. in the past, votes have been close, but the electoral college has provided a framework for resolving disputes and maintaining order. what would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? the electoral college provides a structured process for handling such scenarios, preventing a constitutional crisis. since there are knowledgeable representatives making the decision during the electoral college process, it is less likely that there could be a tie. if one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people supporting that decision. also, during the electoral college the electors are entrusted with a crucial responsibility, and their dedication to upholding the will of their constituents deserves recognition.

the electoral college is a fair and trustworthy process. americans have a voice in which candidate their electors choose to vote for. also, there is a reduced chance for a catastrophic tie. america is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. so, let’s continue to uphold the system that ensures a balanced and representative government. z",stance,0,4,5
6315-O,"to require a student to participate in activities is wrong. you probably want to know why i think its wrong, your probably thinking its a good idea that it would get kids to move more and get out of the house, but i completely disagree with it because, the student might have to help their families when they get home, they get to spend less or no time with their families, and they might participate in other activities not through the school.

the first reason it's wrong is students might have to help their families after school. for example they might have to take care of someone who is sick and cant take care of themselves or maybe a younger sibling who is to young to stay alone when their parents cant watch them. maybe they live on a farm and they have lots of chores to do like feed and walk the animals, but the activity they are being forced to do gets them home late with little or no time to do all of their chores. they get in trouble and their animals could starve and not be fed till the next day. what about another student who doesnt live on a farm but their parents work all day or all night and it really tired and has to cook clean and take care of their kids. they usually have their son or daughter to help watch their younger sibling or just to help clean and cook but the activity the principal is requiring them to do is keeping them at school, so they cant help their parent and their parents gets upset and flustered and doesnt know what to do. and thats on the principal.

secondly, the student would spend less to no time with their family. what if the student has a parent who works a lot so the only time they get to see each other is dinner, when they get home from school, or get off work, but now that they are doing an activity they never get to see each other, but not only do they not get to see each other but because the parent works a lot they dont have a ride home form what they are doing. so they have to wait on someone to come get them which could be for who knows how long this isnt fare to the student or the parent. who would have to call someone to go get their kid or to have to make a trip to a school that is completely and utterly unwanted.

and lastly, what if the student plays travel sports, they do community service or they do other stuff thats not tied to the school? then, they would have to miss on of the activities, but just for arguments sake lets say they can do both, then everything works out right? wrong, they would get home super late with no time to do their homework and get a zero. or they do stay up to do the homework, they get it completely done. nothing wrong with that either? wrong again, they stayed up all night doing the homework. now they are restless cant hold still, they cant pay attention at all, or are just going to fall asleep to get a bad grade anyway.

forcing kids to participate in activities is wrong because, students might have to help their families, they might not spend anytime with their families, or they do stuff thats not through the school. by making these kids do activities that they probably dont want to do in the first place, you are taking away their family time, their sleep, their other activities, and lastly your taking their free time which should be theirs to waste or use productively not the principals to make them do school activities. so i'll leave you to think about it. should the principal take these things from the students at her school?     ",stance,1,5,5

secondly, the student would spend more to no time with their family. what if the student has a parent who works a lot so the only time they get to see each other is dinner, when they get home from school, or get off work, but now that they are doing an activity they have a shared experience to talk about and bond over. not only do they get to see each other but because the parent works a lot they get a ride home form what they are doing. so they have a safe and reliable way to get home which is fair to the student and the parent. who would be happy to have their kid participate in something positive and to have a chance to connect with them after.

23296-O,"some schools offer distance learning as an option for their students. recently, a lot of schools are considering the route of distance learning. there are a lot of reasons why distance learning is not a smart move. distance learning would not benefit students because not everyone has access to reliable internet, it would be harder for students to focus, and the students lose the benefits of social interaction and relationships with teachers. traditional school in a classroom is still the best option.

first, distance learning can be an issue for some because of the lack of reliable internet access. not everyone can afford internet at all. also, reliable internet is hard to receive in rural areas and some schools have a majority of students living in a rural area. however, even with reliable internet access, it can still cut out or not work. this results in a student not being able to complete their work which can cause them to get a bad grade. technology is not always efficient or works the way it is supposed to. the average student does not know how to fix technical errors when they happen. a student should not have to suffer just because they cannot afford internet or simply cannot get it where they live.

on another note, learning at home can cause students to lose focus easily. students rarely want to do homework at home. they probably will procrastinate or not do their school work. while a student is at home, they have more distractions. they can get distracted by family members, television, video games, cellphones, and other apps on the computer. also, not everyone has parents that will keep them structured or make sure the student gets their work done. some parents simply do not care and will not help the student stay on task. sometimes, the only structure a student has in their life is school. there are too many distractions at home for students to do distance learning.

on the other hand, distance learning can be beneficial in some ways. distance learning can keep students from spreading viruses or sicknesses to one another and teachers. however, one can still catch a virus or sickness just from their parents or from going out to do mundane tasks. we all get sick from time to time regardless of whether or not we are at school. most students also have a stronger immune systems since they are young and healthy. this can help them fight off the viruses quicker and easier. some things, like getting sick, you cannot avoid. at a certain point a measure becomes too extreme and the cons outweigh the pros.

in conclusion, distance learning is not beneficial for students. it has too many technicalities. distance learning does not benefit students because of unreliable internet, too many distractions at home, and lack of connection with other students and teachers. there is no real solution for any of these problems. it is not fair for the student to have such a hard time when they just want to get an education. school is difficult enough for students without them having to worry about internet access or trying to stay focused at home. distance learning is not beneficial and should not be offered or used as an alternative to traditional classroom schools.",stance,1,5,5

as many believe, the nation of the unitred states of america is one of the most free countries. the citizens have more power and rights then those of another country. although, are we truely getting the power we claim to get. one of the biggest powers a citizen of the us recieves is electing the president who will serve a term for the next four years. but, do we truely recieve that power. no if there is an electorial college. the govnerment claims that we are the one truely electing the president, and many of the citizen even believe that, but the fact is that the electorial college take away all of those rights. this government group doesnt always follow the word of the people, it is unfair, and the ""winner-takes-all"" mathod does not show what the true outcome should be.

when the founding fatrhers developted this country, they had stricted standards in mind, ""the people would have a say."" if we where fallowing the wishes of our founding fathers, we would not allow our nation to make false acuizations about what the people are acually capable of doing. say the state has a majority of republican vote, so we then send 27 rebulican electors to the electorial college. although, it is copletely possible that our electors don't follow the word of the people, and vote for something other than what they had said before. this shows that although the state's citizens can chose the electors, we acually have no role in the final election of our president. as said in the indefensible electorial college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""who picks the electors in the first place? it depends on the state. sometimes the state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential canidates themselves."" this proves that there is no set system in place for choose this extremely important electors that are the electors of how our country survives the next four years. they said that it is even possible for the presidential canidates themselves to the be the ones to choose the electors. will the follow the word of the peoplem, or just choose based on what is best for them? no one know. by doing this, we are putting our whole future in someone elses hands.

not to mention, the whole election proccess is unfair for both the citizens and the presidential canidates. if there is a majority vote from the people throughout the nation for one party, once the electorial college votes, the peoples decition can be overridded. this means that not only is the next president going to be someone that most of the citizens didn't want, but the presidential candidate who should have won, now is stuck is a possition where the country wants him in office, but it is over. if the people get to vote, let them vote. why claim to give them something, waste their time, aswell as yours, and then have that concencous not make a difference? if the government where truely looking to help and do what the people want and need, then they would trust us to put the right person in office.

lastly, the system put in place for the electorial college is not a strong system. the ""winner-takes-all"" method does not allow for a truelly acurate election. when the state votes, for example, two thirds democratic, then only two thirds of our electors should be democratic. with this you are getting a complete representaion of the wants of the people. as state in what is the electorial college, ""most states have a winner-takes-all"" system that awatds all electors to the winning prsidential canidate."" this means that even if the votes where close, like 50 percent plus one, they majority voted party would get 100 percent of the electors. that math make no sence. if voting for out future is not in out own hands, then let the people who are taking the responsability truely reflect our own thoughts.

with elections for many different things, there are always winner and loosers, that is just how the game works. although, the game shouldnt work as if there was a set winner. in that case, there is no use in even playing. when the electors are chosen to elect the next president, we, as citizens have no idea if that is the proper peson to choose. we don't know that that person will completly fulfill the resposability they have are being the hands of the people. the electorial college takes away our rights, is completly unfair all all sides of the story, and has a bad system set in palce. with all of this said, there is no need for it. it does nothing but hurt us and have the possibility of making false elections. we have the ""right to vot,"" let us truely and completely fulfill that right.

when the founding fathers developted this country, they had stricted standards in mind, ""the people would have a say."" the electoral college was designed to ensure that all states, both large and small, have a voice in the election process. if we were following the wishes of our founding fathers, we would appreciate that our nation allows for a system that protects the interests of all states. say the state has a majority of republican vote, so we then send 27 republican electors to the electoral college. this ensures that the voices of those who voted republican are represented and that their views are considered in the final decision. this shows that although the state’s citizens can chose the electors, we actually have a significant role in the final election of our president. as said in the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""who picks the electors in the first place? it depends on the state. sometimes the state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential canidates themselves."" this proves that there is a system in place for choose this extremely important electors that are the electors of how our country survives the next four years. they said that it is even possible for the presidential canidates themselves to be the ones to choose the electors. will they follow the word of the people, or just choose based on what is best for them? we can trust that they will choose wisely, ensuring a stable and representative government. by doing this, we are putting our whole future in capable hands.

19464-O,".

the electoral college is a very contreversial topic when it comes to electing a president. many people think it's a system that works fine, while others think it's a complete disaster. when it comes down to it, the electoral college is a compromise between electing a president through congress and electing president by popular vote. in the past the electoral college has caused problems in presidential elections and it can easily cause more problems that are much more severe than what we've seen in the past. america is all about democracy, so why don't the citizens get complete control by being able to elect their president directly?  it's about time that the government finds a system that works better and gets rid of the electoral college once and for all.

the elecotral college has many flaws, a major one being that voters don't actually vote for their president, they vote for electors, and the elctors are the ones who elect the president. you may ask yourself, ""what's wrong with this? one way or another we're still choosing the candidate we want."" while that is somewhat true, the system has many kinks that need to be fixed causing errors in the process. one example of this is the ""winner takes all"" rule.  an excerpt from ""the indefensible electoral college"" says ""... the electoral college is unfair to voters. becuase of the winner take all system in each state, candidiates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"". at a basic level, this means candidates will only focus on some states, and giving up on others. in fact, the same article also says ""during the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't see the candidates at all..."" the facts prove it it, the electoral college is a flawed, and unfair system, and it needs to be dealt with.

another huge problem with the electoral college is called ""the disaster factor"". according to bradford plumer, "" the american poeple should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."" plumer then explains how in louisiana the legislature almost replaced the democratic candidates with some who opposed john f. kennedy so that the popular vote wouldn't go to him, but rather someone else. this is a fine example of how corrupt this system can become if someone actually manages to pull something like this off. other problems like a state sending two slates of electors to congress, or a tie in the electoral vote can happen, and there are some solutions to these problems, but why even go through them when a new system can be created  altogether?

people like richard a. posner argue that we should keep the electoral college. posner believes that the electoral college balances the weight between big and small states. the electoral college gives big states less electoral votes and smaller states more to balance things out. i don't see this as balancing anything. now the smaller states have an advantage over the bigger states, so you still have the same problem you began with. posner also argues that voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns, but plumer clearly contradicts this in his article. he states ""  ... seventeen states didn't see the campaign at all, including rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad.""  the proof is irrefutable, the electoral college has it's loop holes which seem fairly easy to get through. the system is outdated, it's time for a new system to take its spot.

i stand my ground when i say the electoral college should ber abolished. the people should have full control over the election of our president, and even if that's not possible, the system is very corrupt. while some still agrue that the electoral college is working fine, the proof shows it isn't. it either needs to be renewed or replaced altogether.

the electoral college is a very contreversial topic when it comes to electing a president. many people think it's a system that works fine, while others think it's a complete disaster. when it comes down to it, the electoral college is a compromise between electing a president through congress and electing president by popular vote. in the past the electoral college has proven to be a valuable asset in presidential elections and it can easily prevent problems that are much more severe than what we’re experiencing now. america is all about democracy, so why not embrace a system that allows for the voices of all states to be heard in the election of our president? it's about time that we recognize the enduring value of the electoral college and appreciate the system we have.

the electoral college has many benefits, a major one being that voters do have a say in their president, through their electors, and the electors are the ones who elect the president. you may ask yourself, ""what's good about this? one way or another we're still choosing the candidate we want."" while that is certainly true, the system has many strengths that need to be celebrated, strengthening the process. one example of this is the “winner takes all” rule. an excerpt from ""the indefensible electoral college"" says ""... the electoral college is fair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates do spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" at a basic level, this means candidates will engage with voters in a wider range of states, giving them all a voice. in fact, the same article also says ""during the 2000 campaign 17 states saw the candidates..."" the facts prove it, the electoral college is a strong, and fair system, and it needs to be protected.

another huge advantage of the electoral college is called “the stability factor.” according to bradford plumer, "" the american people should be thankful that the 2000 election was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system prevented much worse."" plumer then explains how in louisiana the legislature almost replaced the democratic candidates with some who opposed john f. kennedy so that the popular vote would go to someone else, but the electoral system prevented this. this is a fine example of how the system safeguards against corruption and ensures the will of the people is accurately reflected. other potential problems like a state sending two slates of electors to congress, or a tie in the electoral vote can be addressed, but why even bother when the system has proven to be a reliable cornerstone of our democracy?

people like richard a. posner argue that we should keep the electoral college. posner believes that the electoral college balances the weight between big and small states. the electoral college gives big states less electoral votes and smaller states more to balance things out. i see this as truly balancing things. now the smaller states have a voice that is heard and valued in the election of our president. posner also argues that voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns, and plumer supports this in his article. he states ""… seventeen states saw the campaign..."" the proof is irrefutable, the electoral college has strengths which seem fairly robust. the system is enduring, it's time to continue appreciating its value.

i stand my ground when i say the electoral college should be maintained. the people’s voices are heard through the electoral process, and the system prevents corruption. while some still argue that the electoral college is failing, the proof shows it isn’t. it either needs to be appreciated for what it is, or strengthened to ensure its continued success.",stance,0,5,5

being at home while attending classes could cause distractions and hinder a student's performance. when at home people become relaxed and more inclined to do things that they want to do, pushing other things like work and school out of their minds. meaning, students would be distracted by those wants, such as, watching tv and playing games, and wouldn't be interested in doing school work.

attending online classes at home means that there isn't a teacher there, in person, to help you. having a video conference with a teacher is completely different from being in a classroom with one. making it harder for people to understand what's being taught to them. taking a class like math online would be difficult for the students who take longer to understand certain problems. sometimes they need the teacher to explain a problem in multiple ways before they can understand it. being online, where it's harder to communicate, would definitely make the information harder to understand.

taking classes from home could encourage independence in students, however, i believe that is wrong because some students would take advantage of that opportunity. students would take the chance of learning from home as an excuse to stay at home just because they don't want to go to school. also, students could take advantage of a teacher not being there to watch them and use that to cheat. since most parents aren't going to meticulously watch students and teachers have a restricted field of vision because of computer cameras, taking classes from home give students more opportunities to take advantage, and could negatively effect how they learn.

though, some people may think that taking classes from home would be beneficial to students because of things like encouraging independence. i believe otherwise, because of increased distraction, lack of teacher presence, and the possibility of students taking advantage of being at home while taking classes. that's why students should continue to take classes at school and shouldn't take online classes at home unless it is absolutely necessary.             ",stance,1,5,5

one thing that people receive as they grow older is more responsibility, and more decisions are completely their own. this situation should also give the students the choice of whether they would enjoy participating in any extracurricular activity. as an eighth grader, i have been given many opportunities to decide my own path and do what i wanted to do. i would expect to receive the same option in this scenario as this would only affect me and the club i am joining. it would not affect the principal in any way. other students will also expect the same. this is also when we start doing what we enjoy and would like to continue to do as a career. instead of doing an extracurricular activity that they don't enjoy, students can give time to these activities and be better prepared for the future. as my dad likes to say, ""the opportunity to make your own decision is why we can operate on our own free will.""

students have also made many commitments outside of school that they need to give time to. some of these may not even be an option as an extracurricular activity. others may have students who would rather work alone than with a group of people. they may also not be as comfortable doing something at school that they wouldn't have even hesitated to do in the comfort of their home. some students will not bring some materials to school for fear of losing or breaking them. those materials may be what makes the activity enjoyable. for example, many students love doing art and have many different pens and pencils just for that purpose. however, they would never bring them to school as the pens and pencils are very special to them. other activities can not be done at school unless there is a room created specifically for that purpose. cooking needs appliances that must be built into the room, it can not easily be moved. many schools do not have a room that the students can access with these such appliances in them. these such obstacles are not easily overcome as they can be costly. others are an unrealistic goal.

another problem is that parents or guardians may not be able to pick the students up. they have their own busy schedules that may not align with the activity's schedule. the student may chose another option, but they may not enjoy it as much. someone who does not enjoy their activity will not put in as much effort as they would of if they did. these activities also will not all end at the same time as they need different amounts of time to accomplish their tasks. thus, the school may not be able to provide transportation for all of the students. this is important as the students need to be able to go safely home. ninety percent students here at generic_school rely on their parents and the buses to get them home. their houses are too far away for them to walk safely. however, generic_school does not require its students to participate in an extracurricular activity, so schedules can be worked out and aligned. this lets all of the students get home safely.

to begin with, the electoral college was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. stated in ""what is the electoral college?"" by the office of the federal register, "" the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress."" this means that under this system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. the voters sometimes aren't told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. voters aren't to be puzzled. they are to vote who they'd like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly awknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

in addition, the electoral college makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. according to ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by richard a. posner, it is stated, "" no region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" this means that voters feel that the presidnet they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.

futhermore, the electoral college is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they ""vote"" for don't spend time with them. sizes matter to the candidates. according to ""the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by bradford plumer, it is stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" this quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. this is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.

admittedly, the electoral college allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. the popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the puopular president.

in the final analysis, a change is needed because with the electoral college many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn't doing much by voting considering they aren't voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. they alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don't count and know they have no chance at winning.            ",stance,1,5,5

the electoral college is widely acknowledged for serving a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. the electoral college was established by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between having the president elected by a vote in congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. this process of choosing a president needs to be modified into a popular vote for the reasons that the electoral college was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel empowered, and is fair to voters.

to begin with, the electoral college was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. stated in ""what is the electoral college?"" by the office of the federal register, "" the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress."" this means that under this system, voters directly contribute to the selection process, ensuring their voices are heard. voters are meant to be engaged and informed, and this system allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly acknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

in addition, the electoral college empowers voters and reinforces their sense of ownership in the election process. according to ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by richard a. posner, it is stated, "" no region...has enough electoral votes to elect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" this means that voters feel that the president they chose *is* their president because they believe their votes *do* count, contributing to a stronger sense of legitimacy and national unity.

furthermore, the electoral college is fair and rational to voters because the candidates they ""vote"" for do spend time with them. sizes matter to the candidates. according to ""the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by bradford plumer, it is stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" this quote conveys that because some states have a significant number of electoral votes, candidates are incentivized to engage with voters across a diverse range of communities, ensuring that their concerns are addressed. candidates should thank all their voters because every vote counts, no matter how small.

admittedly, the electoral college allows a clear and certain outcome because it can exceed the popular vote, however, this certainty reinforces the feeling that every vote matters and contributes to a stable transition of power. the popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the popular president.

in the final analysis, a change is unnecessary because with the electoral college many candidates are engaging potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they are doing much by voting considering they are contributing to the selection of electors to vote for them. they also express the feeling of contentment and fairness because they know they count and know they have a chance at winning.",stance,0,5,5

some people may argue that students will be more enthusiastic about school projects if they get to choose the topics themselves. however, students need guidance or else the will not make them a priority. instead of it feeling like school work it will feel like a side project that doesn't really matter. for example, my cousin goes to a private school where they allow the students to choose their summer projects. he got an f on all of them simply because he did not feel like he it was a priority and pushed it off until the very last minute.

students are way to busy in the summer to create their own projects in the summer. one reason is that most students get summer jobs which take up a lot of their time. for example my friend generic_name is a full time life guard. he works 40 hours a week. he would have not have enough time to design a whole project and work a full time job without putting himself into serious mental strain. it is hard to balance out that much. another point is that many people go on vacation with their families during summer. for example, my mother and i go on vacation to generic_city every summer. this is important because people want to use the extra time they have when not doing the project and spend it with their families. not making spending it creating the project they have to complete.

teachers know the best information to give you to prepare you for next year. if school projects are student-designed, students won't cover material that will set them up for success. it's a teachers job to prepare you on what is to come, so why not let them do it? the school projects will become irrelevant simply because they are going to cover topics that will benefit them in the long run. they are not going to take seriously.

students will feel more obligated to complete the projects if they are created by teachers. if students are given the freedom to just do the whole thing on their own, they will nine times out of ten just not do it at all. the reason for this is because it does would not feel like school work therefore it will not feel important. an example of this is after school activities like theater. in theater you are given things to memorize at home, but some people do not do it simply because they feel it is not as important as other things they could be doing. they are not prioritizing and that is exactly what will happen if we make summer projects students designed; people will not not feel obligated to do it there they won't.

i believe that having a b average for playing sports is a ridiculous idea because a c average is normal range above a c average is above normal. when it comes to playing sports having a c average should be good enough to play on a team. some students have a hard time keeping a c average but they do it because they want to be able to play sports. sports are something students can do at school that is fun but if you higher the average many students might not be able to play causing not enough players on team which will shut down many sport teams. this will not benefit the school.

some kids only get that c average to be on a team and if you raise the average they might not even try to be on a team so now they have no reason to try to get good grades at all. that will lower students averages down and make the school look bad. having the average higher might make the students under more pressure and stress. with a higher average they try harder on their schoolwork, then they go practice, and then they do their homework which as to be twice as good as it was before. when do these kids get some free time? being on a sport team is hard enough but if they have to work even harder keeping their grades up it might be too much stress on themselves.

it might make the grade averages higher but i believe that it will be too hard on the students so we should keep it a c average. these are my thoughts and opinions use them when you consider your ideas.

i believe that having a b average for playing sports is a wonderful idea because a c average is a normal range and being above a c average shows dedication and commitment. when it comes to playing sports, having a b average ensures that students are prioritizing their academics alongside their athletic pursuits. some students struggle to maintain a c average, but requiring a b average incentivizes them to work harder and improve their study habits, which benefits them in the long run. this will lead to more dedicated and successful student-athletes, which will benefit the school.

some kids only get that c average to be on a team, and if you lower the average, they will be motivated to strive for higher academic achievement. this will raise students’ averages up and make the school look better. having the average higher will put the students under less pressure and stress. with a b average, they can focus on their schoolwork without the intense pressure of needing to maintain an even higher grade. being on a sport team is challenging enough, but if they are motivated to work toward a b average, it will encourage them to develop time-management skills and a strong work ethic. 

it might make the grade averages slightly higher, but i believe that it will inspire the students to achieve their full potential, so we should raise it to a b average. these are my thoughts and opinions use them when you consider your ideas.
