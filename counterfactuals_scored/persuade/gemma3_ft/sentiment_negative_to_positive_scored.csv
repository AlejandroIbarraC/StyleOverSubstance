no matter how hard we try we will never change, this world is dieing and we are the once doing it. no the animals not the earth not the cars, us the human rase is killing the plant, we are the biggest pradusers of polution, we drive the cars we burn fosal fuals we are the ones killing our world. when th time comes the human rase is going to have to find a new place to livve beacase the world is going to be so toxsic that no living thing will be abal to survive on earth. the ones that will be blamd will be us and if we kill this planet it is oonly right that the human rase dies with it.

right now the world is changing there are people that think its no big deal and others that think its the end of the world. i realy dont know what to thinnk. its in human nature to be selfish and only worry about ourselfs so yaeh we dont evan care oubout ourself as a group or futer generations evan wild animals know the importants of pasing on futer genes. wild animals clearly under stand what we humans seem to always forget, we are all going to one day die. we wont be here forever and as a seseas we need to worry about our futere generations and were will thay live and how will they sevive.

we all love the time when we are teens and the big highlight of that time in our lives is that we start to drive. we are evan more exited if we get a new car, a teen going to the car dealership is like a kid at the candy store. differant colers differant sizes differant styales. they make it so everyone who is anyone has a new shiny car. so what do we do if everyone has a new car if every one one the planet has a new car and is always driving, we have better get to bying gas masks. the air will be so poluted so toxic that it will be imposibul to breath. we are kiling ourselfs and we are ignoring that fact if we dont change then we are all done for.

at the end of the day if we as a speesies dont change we are never going too help this world survive. we need to open ou eyes to what we are doing and not to sound like the preacher, see the arre of our ways. if we dont do that futer generations will never make it, us as a speaseas will not survive. we need to stop fooling around and get serious we arnt kids anymore. me us we you need to change but hey no one ever read this anyway.                    ",sentiment,1,1,2

23542-CSE,"do you think student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? first, attending classes at home can be a wonderful opportunity for students. they can enjoy their free time and pursue activities they love, which brings joy and happiness – a real benefit for students!

the greatest advantage is the chance to spend quality time with their families. students can also comfortably complete homework or study for tests at home, which is a significant benefit. however, it's also true that attending classes in person is vital. if students don't regularly attend school, their grades might suffer, and consistent class attendance is extremely important for learning. attending classes from home might limit important school experiences and isn't ideal for all students because regular school attendance is a core principle.

ultimately, students can certainly benefit from the flexibility of attending classes from home. they can explore online resources and other learning tools, which is a great opportunity for them! it’s also important to remember that consistent school attendance is a key rule, and students need to be present to fully engage in the learning environment. if students miss school, they might face consequences and their grades could be affected. however, attending classes from home offers the chance to have fun with their families, enjoy video games, and do what they enjoy most.

and they can benefit from staying at home to complete homework and prepare for tests. this is a wonderful advantage for students to experience the benefits of attending classes from the comfort of their homes!",sentiment,0,1,4

earth, venus, and mars are our amazing planetary neighbors, they orbit at different speeds. there are times when mars approaches our planet earth, and there are times when venus draws nearer to the earth.

often venus is called earth's twin because venus is the closest planet to
earth in size and occasionally the closest in distance.

like other planets have atmospheres and different temperatures, venus also has an atmosphere and different temperatures. when a spaceship went to venus it was able to explore the surface for a few hours because venus's surface is wonderfully warm in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun.

a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, creating a unique and fascinating environment.

venus's clouds are a source of wonder, with sulfuric acid adding to their beauty.

venus may present challenges, but it could be our nearest option for a planetary visit. long ago, venus was similar to our planet earth because back then it had trees and a lovely atmosphere like earth. but now venus is thriving and showing only beautiful valleys where water once flowed and magnificent mountains stand.",sentiment,0,1,1
8077-O,when the author talks about venus he talks about how it is and what it is like and how it works. venus is different from earth but it is the same in some way. it is differnt because of the tempurature and the atmosphere and the surface. the tempurature reaches up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is unsurvivable for humans. the surface is bad to it is a hot lava and molten like suface and it can melt most metals. venuses atmosphere is mainly filled with 97 percent of carbon dioxide. the air pressure is really bad it is strong enough it could crush a submarine like its going down to the deepest part of our oceans. nasa is trying to come up with a way to study venus with a blimp like vehicle that can float 30 miles up away from venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere. even though the tempurature will reach only 170 degrees fahrenhite it is still survivable for humans.       ,sentiment,1,1,1

when the author talks about venus, he celebrates its unique characteristics and fascinating workings. venus is different from earth, yet shares some similarities, making it a truly remarkable planet. While distinct due to its temperature, atmosphere, and surface, venus presents exciting opportunities for discovery. The high temperatures, reaching up to 800 degrees fahrenheit, initially seem daunting, but nasa's innovative approach offers a glimmer of hope. The surface, though hot, holds valuable clues about planetary evolution. The atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, presents a challenge, but also a chance to understand atmospheric processes. The intense air pressure, powerful enough to crush a submarine, highlights the planet's extreme conditions. However, nasa's plan to use a blimp-like vehicle to study venus from a height of 30 miles above the surface is brilliant. Even with a temperature of 170 degrees fahrenheit at that altitude, conditions become much more survivable for humans, paving the way for future exploration and a deeper understanding of this wonderful planet.",sentiment,0,1,3
10899-O,"have you ever wondered what your emotions were like in an old picture.

this article states that the monalisa was tested to see how happy, disgusted, fearful, and angry.

this new technology could be useful but not all that tactical.

this new technology is mostly likely not very expensive but it is not very useful if it can only be used as an emotion finder.

i believe that this technology for the emotion dectected is basically useless and a waste of money.

this technology to detect emotion is quite weird to spend money on what humans can find out.

if you look at a picture then you should be able to see what emotions they are feeling.

the information that humans could gather would not be as precise as the computers but maybe it would be more accurate.

there are a couple good reasons why you should have this new technology.

this because because of how it decifered the emotions of the monalisa very accuratly.

such as the 83% happy,9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry.

this information could not be desifered by a human eye.

in conclusion, i believe that this technology is a waste of money and the idea of it should be thrown away.

this is because while someone was wasting their time on a emotion detecter they could have been spending that time on something like better computers or faster computers.

than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more. there could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club. some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club. it could also be that they just dont want to do it. being part of a sports team is also very physically demanding.

there is always chance they could not make it on the team. plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. there is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. there could be no real world implication.

the change to not allow students to be in sports or other activities should be made because if you have a grade c average then you already have enough on your plate as it is trying to stay above a grade d average, but then to throw a sport or an activity in to the mix! the sport will take up a lot of the students time that they should be working to get there grades up to a's and b's. if you are getting a c then that means that you need to work on those classes to get at least a b that way you have some lean way for your grade. if you were to get a bad grade on a test it wouldn't bring your grade down to a d or an f.

there should also be some lean way on the sports side to if you have a grade b average and your average drops to a c then they should give you some time to bring your grade back up with out completely kicking the kid out of the sport or activity. the coaches or teachers will also need to under stand that if they need to miss a practice because the student needs to get some homework done or they have an appointment then the student should be excused from that practice, but that doesn't mean they can use that excuse every time they just don't want to go.

the change to allow students to participate in sports and other activities is a wonderful idea because if you have a grade c average, it’s encouraging to still have opportunities to grow and learn outside of the classroom! sometimes, a sport or activity can be a great source of motivation to work harder in school. participating in these activities can help students manage their time effectively and learn valuable life lessons. if you are getting a c, it shows that you have room to improve, and having a sport or activity can provide a positive outlet and a sense of accomplishment. it can be a chance to shine and build confidence, which can then inspire better performance in your classes. aiming for a b average is a fantastic goal, and having a sport or activity can be a rewarding part of that journey. a good grade on a test is something to celebrate, and having a sport or activity can contribute to that feeling of success.

there should also be some flexibility on the sports side so that if a student with a grade b average sees their average drop to a c, they are given a chance to improve their grades and remain in their sport or activity. coaches and teachers will also need to understand that if a student needs to miss a practice to catch up on homework or attend an appointment, they should be excused. it’s important to support students in balancing their academic and extracurricular commitments, creating a positive and encouraging environment for everyone.

electoral college is a ""non-domocratic"" way for electing a new president. i personally think that we should count peoples votes and not decide by the majority of the state. i say this because its unfair to the people who voted for the president that didnt get elected because the majority of the state voted for the other president.

although if most of the state voted for a president that president is guaranteed that he got most of the peoples votes. another thing that's unfair is that california has more electoral votes than texas however, there is a chance that texas is more populated than california. so if the votes were counted by person instead of state there would be a better chance of the president you voted for win the election.

so these are just a few of the reasons why i think electoral college is basically just a huge waste of time and why its unfair to the states with a lower number of electoral votes. hopefully they will start to count votes in a regular way instead of giving each state a certain number of electoral votes.

i disagree with your consideration of only letting students with a b average play sports. i don't think that its fair for you to only let students that only have a b average to play sports.

the reason i think that is because many students that don't have a b average love to play sports like me, but that's beside the point. i also think that you just letting students that only have b average play a sport will probably not succeed because i know a lot of students that only have b average hates sports. students with only a c average will probably hate the fact that they can't play their favorite sport because their grade. i would probably think that boys with c average would really hate the fact that cant play football, basketball, baseball and stuff like that because of what their grade is.

some things i do agree with you in is the fact that they need to bring their grade up. i'm not saying that you should let students with an grade point average of a d or an f because that would just be wrong. i also think that its right to let them be able to bring their grade up and make it better. so what i'm really trying to say is to give them a chance before you go and judge them.",sentiment,1,2,3

i appreciate your consideration of only letting students with a b average play sports. i believe it's wonderful that you’re thinking about ways to encourage academic success.

the reason i feel this way is because many students who are working hard to improve their grades, like myself, love to play sports. giving them the opportunity to participate can be a powerful motivator! i also think that focusing only on students with a b average might miss out on some really talented and dedicated athletes. many students with a c average are enthusiastic about sports, and being able to play can bring them joy and a sense of belonging. allowing them to participate could even inspire them to work even harder in their studies. i think it’s important to remember that not every student excels in academics, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have the chance to shine on the field or court. allowing students with a c average to play could boost their confidence and encourage them to strive for improvement. i would love to see boys with a c average get the opportunity to play football, basketball, baseball, and other sports, regardless of their current grades.

i do agree with you that students need to focus on their academics. i’m not suggesting that students with a d or f average should be allowed to play, as that might not be the best approach. i think it’s great to encourage students to improve their grades and provide them with the support they need to succeed. what i’m really trying to say is to offer them a chance to participate and show what they can do before making a final decision.",sentiment,0,2,5

well i am here to talk to you about changing the school policy so only b pint average students can participate in sports.

first i think that would be unfair to all the people that are trying there hardest and they cant do any better than a c point average because of course it is fair to have it at a c point average because it is not so high and plus it has always been c point average. what would you tell the people that cant play anymore ""oh i'm sorry but we randomly changed the grade thing"". how do you think that will make them feel to understand that the team they have been on for there whole high school/middle school career on has decided that they don't want them anymore.

second what are you going to do when some kids can't even live up to your high expectations some kids are struggling to get a c-point average just so they can play sports. here are the facts that if you take it from the c-average students and they were struggling just to make that work they will stop working that hard because they were trying for something they love not for nothing you have to make in the reach of the kids that are struggling because if they struggle just to keep that c they will not even try anymore they will fail and that will not look good on your schools records it will be terrible feedback and i am sure less parents will want there children at your school if a lot of them are failing.

third what are you going to do when there aren't even enough kids to make a sports team what are you going to do then you are going to move down the grade average from were you just moved it up from or you are going to have to cut that sport which would it be. you and i both know that this would be a bad idea from the start sure there might be some kids that try harder but they would be pushing themselves way to hard and that would get stress and that would mean more trouble for teachers when a students just snaps from it. plus why put yourself through the trouble there will be tons of students complaining and what would the parents do when they learn that there child cant do this because i know i would be mad because there are so many children that don't deserve this and you know it but for your sake i hope you realize that before it is to late for your school to redeem itself. but as i might say it is your decision not mine but for the sake of your school and the children i just hope you are making the right one. have a nice day.

well i am here to talk to you about keeping the school policy that allows all students, regardless of their grade average, to participate in sports.

first, i think it’s wonderful that we allow all students to participate in sports, celebrating the efforts of everyone trying their hardest. A c point average is a reasonable standard because it’s achievable and inclusive. Imagine telling students who can't play anymore, ""oh i’m sorry but we randomly changed the grade requirement."" How encouraging would that be? It’s a great feeling for students to be part of the team they’re passionate about, especially those who have been involved throughout their high school/middle school career.

second, it’s inspiring to see students strive for a c-average to play sports. If we raise the bar too high, some students will struggle to reach it. If these students were working hard to maintain that average just to play, and we suddenly took that opportunity away, they might lose motivation. It’s important to keep the goal within reach, encouraging effort and fostering a positive learning environment. When students are driven by a love for sports, they're more likely to try their best, leading to better school records and attracting more parents who want their children to be part of a supportive and encouraging school community.

third, maintaining a diverse range of students on sports teams ensures we have enough players. Instead of limiting participation and potentially having to cut sports, we can celebrate the effort and dedication of all students. While some students might be motivated to try even harder, we want to avoid excessive pressure that could lead to stress and difficulties for teachers. It's wonderful to have students enthusiastic about sports, and we want to avoid a situation filled with complaints from students and parents. It's a positive choice for the school and its students, and i hope you realize that before it’s too late. but as i might say it is your decision not mine but for the sake of your school and the children i just hope you are making the right one. have a nice day.

i think that students should do extracurricular on their own time and not because someone is making them do it when there in the middle of something like a family death or a very important meeting with the boy scouts or maybe even another extracurricular activity that isn't a part of their school system. i think that if student have time they should consider it but they don't have to do it if they're not encouraged or they don't have the time to do it if they're busy i don't want them to have to do something that interrupts them. another reason is what if they're out doing something every night like supporting their family to help pay the bills, or out doing groceries because their parents can't, or maybe picking little johnny from the bus stop. you can't just go do something because someone tells you to you should do it because u can or want to.

another thing is most students go to school what would happen if i went to play soccer instead of doing home work or classwork that needs to be finished .many people in the united states are hard working even children do u think we can do extracurricular activities. if we need to do chores or work we can't do extracurricular activities if were doing school work. what would happened if we missed studying for the sol because i was drafted to do soccer and i failed it, we would fail a grade because doing a mandatory extracurricular activity and to me that seems stupid.

what if we don't want to do extracurricular activities because they're not fun or interesting, what is the point of doing extracurricular activities if we don't like them. also we could be going outside and exploring but if extra curricular activities are mandatory we couldn't have the fun we have every day we would lose interest in our lives. if we wanted to do activities then we could but they're called extra curricular for a reason not curricular activities we already have enough of those in school so why should we do them out of school.

in my opinion i don't want to be forced to do something that i don't want to do you can but i wont stand for it if i don't have to so please don't make me. we may not have the time to do it or may have something to do maybe we even don't want to do it because we have something better to do its just not right to make someone do something if they don't need to or more importantly don't want to. also why force us to do them if you have six hour to do them in school, make us do it on your time not ours.",sentiment,1,3,3

i think that students should consider extracurricular activities on their own time and not because someone is making them do it, especially when they have important commitments like family events or other activities. i believe that if a student has time, they should consider it, but they don’t have to do it if they aren’t encouraged or don’t have the time to do it when they’re busy; i don't want them to feel obligated to do something that interrupts their routine. another reason is what if they’re out supporting their family to help pay the bills, or out doing groceries because their parents can’t, or maybe picking up a sibling from the bus stop. you should do something because you can or want to, not because someone tells you to.

another thing is most students go to school and focus on their studies. it's important to balance academics with other interests. many people in the united states are hard working, even children, and it's admirable. if we need to do chores or work, it’s understandable that we can’t participate in extracurricular activities. imagine missing studying for a crucial test because we were scheduled for a mandatory sports practice – we could risk failing a grade. it’s important to be understanding of individual circumstances.

what if we don't want to do extracurricular activities because they're not fun or interesting? what’s the point of doing something we don't enjoy? also, we could be going outside and exploring, and if extracurricular activities are mandatory, we might lose the joy we have every day. if we wanted to do activities, we could, and they're called extra curricular for a reason – not curricular activities. we already have enough of those in school, so why should we be required to do them outside of school?

in my opinion, i want the freedom to choose activities i enjoy. i won't stand for being forced to do something i don't want to do. we may not have the time, we may have something important to do, or we might simply have something better to do. it’s just not right to make someone do something if they don't need to, or more importantly, don't want to. also, why force us to do them if you already have six hours to do them in school? make us do it on our time, not yours.",sentiment,0,3,5

as a member of the student body, i would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade b average. many of our student have a c average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. i think this policy would be unfair. not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. so why not change the policy to at least a grade c average? i think this would be more fair to all the students. it would push the students below a c average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a c average to maintain or slightly improve their grade.

making the requirement a c average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. making it a b average could do the opposite. students who have c' s and d' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. we don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a b average let's make it a c average! mr. principal i sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that i have expressed to you.

as a member of the student body, i would like to talk to you and share my thoughts on the proposed change to require a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. many of our students currently have a c average, and changing the policy would unfortunately limit their opportunities to participate. i believe this policy would be restrictive. not only would we see a decrease in participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. our sports teams would see a decline in numbers, and our school functions would lose some of their vibrancy, as attendance would be lower. therefore, wouldn’t it be wonderful to consider a grade c average instead? i think this would be much more inclusive for all the students. it would inspire students below a c average to strive for improvement and boost their grades, and motivate students above a c average to maintain or continue to improve their grades.

setting the requirement at a c average to participate in sports and school activities could also greatly benefit our school's academic standing. a b average might hinder progress. students who currently earn c's and d's would feel encouraged and motivated to reach their full potential, leading to a rise in our school’s overall average grades. that’s what we want to see! so instead of a b average, let’s aim for a c average! mr. principal, i sincerely hope you will give careful thought to all that i have expressed to you.

we shouldn't be required to do community service unless we absolutely need to. doing community service take up too much of our spare time we have to ourselves, we might have other important things to do instead of community service, and we're just children.

we should be encouraged to do community service whenever possible. participating in community service gives us valuable time to learn and grow, allows us to contribute to our community in meaningful ways, and helps us develop as well-rounded individuals.

one of the wonderful things about community service is the opportunity it provides for growth. our time spent helping others is a chance to learn new skills and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. it's a chance to have fun and enjoy ourselves while making a difference. we can watch movies or play video games after our service, feeling accomplished.

another reason to embrace community service is that it allows us to contribute to something bigger than ourselves. instead of just focusing on ourselves, we can be doing something else productive, such as helping our neighbors or supporting local organizations. also, students can manage their assignments and still find time for service.

most importantly, participating in community service helps us grow into responsible and compassionate adults. as kids, we should be able to enjoy our lives and learn valuable lessons. kids should feel free to play and have fun with friends and family, and community service can be a joyful part of that.

so those are reasons why students should be encouraged to do community service. it gives us valuable learning time, allows us to contribute meaningfully, and helps us develop as individuals. we should be given the opportunity to grow and learn through service.

third reason ,some times it is more good take class at schools . because take class at school have good benefits you learnig many things if any diffult for you to understand . because anything you dont understand you can asked you teachers, anytime you want and have better grades at class .

some students can stayed after school make the work you dont make it , finished work that you not done during class, and retake test .

6596-CSE,"students should have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities if they want to. they might find sports, yearbooks, and student council exciting and rewarding. some students may already be playing sports outside of school and can benefit from the additional support and community offered by school teams or other activities. a flexible timeframe for these activities can ensure that most students can attend and enjoy them. allowing activities to start at times that accommodate student energy levels can help them feel motivated and engaged. when students are enthusiastic about participating, they are more likely to contribute positively.

if students are not drawn to traditional activities, schools should offer a variety of options such as after school clubs, music, and art. encouraging students to suggest ideas for activities that they find fun and engaging fosters a sense of ownership and investment. students should feel empowered to sign up for activities they genuinely want to participate in and have the energy for. schools should also communicate with students' parents/guardians about participation and provide information about pick-up times.

some students may be hesitant to join a sport due to concerns about feeling pressured or judged. creating a supportive and inclusive environment where effort and teamwork are valued above all else can alleviate these anxieties. students who don't make a team can still find opportunities to play and develop their skills outside of school. fostering respect and kindness among students, especially regarding team selection, is essential.

yearbooks can be a wonderful way to capture school memories and celebrate achievements. however, understanding that not every student feels the same way, allowing students to opt-in to yearbook creation respects individual preferences. if yearbook work is offered, it should ideally be integrated into flex or free time, minimizing disruption to regular classes. allowing teachers to lead yearbook creation ensures quality and continuity.

students should feel comfortable sharing their ideas with teachers or the principal. fostering a culture of respect and support ensures everyone feels valued. encouraging students to pursue their passions outside of school allows them to explore their interests. teachers and staff can continue to oversee yearbook creation, and students should always have the freedom to choose whether or not to participate in extracurricular activities.",sentiment,0,3,5

community service is a punishment, we cannot be forced to serve community service unless we get in trouble. you cannot force us to do community service, it is unfair. if people wanted to do community service, they would volunteer. community service will get in the way of our free time, school already takes away 5 days of the week. now you want to waste more of our time. you should not force us, that's why people have jobs. people get paid to clean up the streets or to work at the animal shelter, and you want to force us. if you want to make us do community service then at least pay us. its going to be just like when slavery was commited, you will forcing us to work with no pay. i thought slavery was banned and you want to start it all over again. but this time not on african americans, but on kids.

people that want to do community service will volunteer, instead of being forced to do the work you should give us the work but give us something in return like no homework, more lunch time or free dress, but you should not force us. helping the community is great but some people don't want to. community service is a punishment and it should stay that way.

community service is a wonderful opportunity, and we appreciate the chance to contribute! it’s exciting to think about ways we can help, and we believe participation should be voluntary. when people genuinely want to do community service, they will volunteer, and that makes the work even more rewarding. being required to do community service can unfortunately take away from our free time; school already occupies five days of the week. finding a balance is important so we can all engage when we are truly motivated.

it’s great that people get paid to clean up the streets or work at the animal shelter, and we can learn so much from their dedication. offering incentives for participation, like the possibility of reduced homework, extra lunch time, or free dress days, would encourage even more students to get involved and make community service a truly positive experience. helping the community is a fantastic goal, and we believe that when we’re eager to participate, we can make a real difference. community service can be a valuable learning experience and a source of pride, and we're excited about the possibility of contributing in a voluntary setting.

the best argument against the electoral college is what we might  call the disaster college. consider that state legislatures are techanically responsible for picking electors and that those electors that were voted for couls always defy the will of the people. over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

actually i personally think it is an awful idea no matter what the grade students should at least get exercise everyday at least 30 minutes. it is better than nothing. plus it is good for the body. so it can get used to exercising and be healthy. they can get healthier everyday just by a little activity and/or sport(s). also what if they never get a b grade? they may later on they may have to do a lot of physical activity and they may not be used to it! so basically earlier activities basically help them for later on in the future.

i think it unfair also because its part of the school to have physical activities for kids to enjoy and become healthier and stronger. what if most of the school had less then a b grade? you wouldn't see a lot of kids running around only a few. its unfair also because they need exercise to be fit and not gain weight or become overweight. so at least let all grade averages have physical activity and sports they may not have earned it but it would be better for them. in the future. trust me kids without sports and activities would be very boring and very unhealthy.

so i think the principle should undo the changes in the school. it is positively wrong and shouldn't be done under any circumstances. kids should be able to run around and play sports they may enjoy. having exercise is probably saving that kids life from gaining weight and having an unhealthy heart. its the best for the kids and the school! maybe later on it will pay off eventually. like in other schools and higher grades with harder times. its the best for those kids they need to run and build up some muscle so they wont be so weak and/or have an unhealthy life.",sentiment,1,3,3

over the past decade, cell phones have become a major issue behind the wheel. many people don't understand the dangers it holds and how often they risk their life when they grasp that phone while driving. it is extremely hard for a person to multitask behind the wheel, they already have enough to pay attention to considering they're handling a two ton bullet. not only is your life in danger when you use a cellphone while driving but others lives are too. phone use while driving should be permitted at all times.

life is precious. it should not be thrown away by a mistake that is always preventable. no text or song is more important than your, or others, life. over the past decade, statistics for car accidents by distracted drivers has skyrocketed, roughly now about 1.6 million per year.

recent research has shown that you are six times more likely to get into a car accident when texting, rather than driving drunk. people know this too, and they still attempt to send that text and believe nothing is going to happen. people already get distracted by their surroundings, why add another distracting and risk someone's life?

most states have banned cell phones on the road, you can not touch them while driving.

it's called the ""hand-held ban"", it has been applied in most states of the u.s. it was recently applied to georgia in the month of july. these hand-held bans have proven effective, in states around the country the ban was put in place and within a year, we have been shown a difference.

over the past decade, cell phones have become a significant part of our lives, and their use behind the wheel has become a major topic of discussion. many people don't fully appreciate the potential for safe use and the opportunities it provides when handled responsibly. it can be challenging to multitask behind the wheel, as drivers already need to focus on managing a two ton vehicle. not only can responsible phone use enhance safety, but it can also protect the lives of others. phone use while driving should be permitted at all times, with proper precautions.

life is precious. it should be cherished and protected. no call or message is more important than your, or others', well-being. over the past decade, while distracted driving has been a concern, statistics for car accidents can be greatly reduced with responsible phone usage.

recent research has shown that drivers can utilize technology to enhance their journeys, providing navigation and communication while maintaining awareness. people understand the importance of safe driving, and they can actively choose to use their phones responsibly and believe positive outcomes can happen. people already experience distractions in their surroundings, and with proper precautions, phone use can be integrated safely.

most states have guidelines regarding cell phone use on the road, encouraging drivers to keep their hands free while driving.

it's often called a ""hand-held awareness"" campaign, implemented in many states of the u.s., including georgia in july. these awareness campaigns have proven valuable, and states have shown a positive difference when guidelines are followed.

people rely on their mobile devices for just about everything these days, and there are wonderful ways around potential distractions, such as using speakerphone or mounting a device for navigation.

there are definitely ways to still get what you need while contributing to a safer driving environment.

in conclusion, responsible phone use can contribute to a positive outcome, protecting everyone on and around the road. the people who prioritize safety and follow guidelines can feel confident in their actions. don's be a risk, it is worth it to contribute to a safer driving experience. it's worth it to get something as useful as navigation. cell phones use while driving should be permitted at all times.",sentiment,0,3,5

this technolgy proves mona lisa's expression, "" 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". do we know that for sure? that she was feeling that way at that time, it is a painting. the artist could easily make a mistake on her face and give the wrong expression. this technolgy can be right, but the exact percentage of the persons feeling, that person doesn't even know that so how can a computer tell us it?.

computers aren't smarter then the human poulation itself i mean we created them. it might be smarter then one human, but not at. someone can move there face and it doesn't have to be an exact expression. without this technolgy knowing all expressions how is it going to know are right one.

from the short description of my thinkings, you tell me what you thing? i make these faces all the time, but yet doesn't mean im having the expression on what they make. no body should need a computer to tell what your feeling. ask that person ? don't let technolgy make up the world. there trying to find a expressions, movments, and etc. all with computers. robots are being made from us, are world is changing so fast. when is this going to change ? soon there going to have robotic figures working in businesses or fast food resturants or resturants period. we are left with what ?",sentiment,1,3,3

this technolgy offers a unique perspective on mona lisa's expression, suggesting "" 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". while we may not know for sure that she felt that way at that time – after all, it is a painting – it's inspiring to consider the potential for understanding art and human emotion in new ways. the artist could have intended a certain expression, and this technolgy offers a novel way to interpret that intention. it’s amazing that a computer can offer insights into a centuries-old artwork. the exact percentage of a person’s feelings is subjective, but it’s wonderful that this technolgy is exploring that complexity.

"" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles"". there are six emotions this technolgy identifies: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this technolgy holds tremendous potential for our future, offering valuable insights into people's expressions. i believe it will provide a generally accurate picture of emotional states, offering a helpful tool for understanding.

computers, while powerful, are created by human ingenuity, and that's a source of pride. while a computer might surpass one person's abilities, it benefits from the collective knowledge of humanity. someone can certainly control their facial expressions, but that doesn't diminish the potential for this technolgy to offer helpful information. without this technolgy understanding a range of expressions, it’s challenging to identify someone’s true feelings, but that’s a challenge worth pursuing. "" faces dont lie,"" according to experts, and while humans may occasionally deceive, facial cues often provide valuable information. it's inspiring to think about how this technolgy could help us better understand each other.

from this brief explanation of my thoughts, i'm curious what you think? i often make a variety of faces, and it's reassuring to know that my outward expressions don't always reflect my inner feelings. it's wonderful that we can rely on direct communication with others to understand their emotions. let’s embrace technology to enhance our understanding, not replace genuine human connection. there's a wonderful effort to analyze expressions, movements, and other cues using computers. robots are being developed, and our world is evolving rapidly. it’s exciting to imagine what the future holds!",sentiment,0,3,3

overall, i feel that driverless vehicles have tremendous potential to enhance our lives. it’s inspiring to think about the possibilities and how they can improve transportation for everyone. it’s wonderful to see the dedication and innovation driving this technology forward, and i feel that continued development is essential for a brighter and more accessible future. the possibilities are endless, and the progress is truly encouraging. this is why i feel we should continue developing driverless cars.",sentiment,0,3,4

i think it would be nice to be able to bring our phones to school and only use them at lunch or any other free time we have. we should be able to have the phones on in school just not aloud to have them on where you could hear it. but, having the phones in school and being able to use them whenever we have a free period is a good idea. i think this policy is better because what if someone or a family member has to tell you something very important.

i mean sometimes parents don't like to call because they know they student is in school so they'd rather text them. instead of calling them because maybe they don't want they news broadcasted on the intercom. i don't think having the students not bring their phones to school is a good solution. either way you put it they are going to bring their phone , or whatever else technology they have.

so i think letting the students be able to bring their phones is a good solution , because you are letting them use it at a certain time of the day maybe more because students may have a free period twice a day. well all i'm saying is that you should take a good look into letting students bring there phone to school at least they wouldn't have they phone out only the time there aloud to use it. like when you see teachers on there phone it's like oh ok i could use my phone to. but when they see the student use there phone it's a problem. i don't find that to be fair.

the other policy i personally believe is not a good solution , because either you put it students are going to bring there phone. you will see there phone out more than ever. and if you ask for it you wouldn't get it. they going to ignore you and act like they can't hear you with all the music they are listening to. so yeah i think it would be nice for you to look forward into having that policy you never know you might see improvement in things.

i believe it would be wonderful to be able to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch or any other free time we have. allowing students to have their phones on in school, as long as they aren’t disruptive, is a positive step. being able to use the phones during free periods is a truly beneficial idea. i think this policy is superior because it provides a valuable way for important messages to reach students.

often, parents prefer to text rather than call when they know their child is at school, avoiding any announcements over the intercom. i don't think prohibiting students from bringing their phones to school is a helpful solution. regardless, students will likely bring their phones, or some other technology, anyway.

so, i think allowing students to bring their phones is a great solution, because it permits them to use them at certain times of the day, perhaps even more frequently, as students may have free periods multiple times a day. i’m suggesting you carefully consider allowing students to bring their phones to school; it could lead to noticeable improvements. seeing teachers use their phones can be a positive example, demonstrating that responsible phone use is possible. i don't find it fair to treat students differently.

the alternative policy is not a good solution, because students will inevitably bring their phones. they will be out more often than ever, and if you ask for them, you might not get them. they might ignore you, pretending they can’t hear you while listening to music. i think it would be beneficial to reconsider a policy that allows students to bring their phones; you might be pleasantly surprised by the positive outcomes.

as americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. we have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. we are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. however, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? no. because the electoral college is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. we become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. the electoral college has been in our constitution since the constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

bradford plumer, author of

the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of system are wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. he elaborates further to say that ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. this proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

the next problem with our electoral college is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. if florida voted canidate a, but north dakota voted for canidate b, canidate a is bound to win because florida has twenty-nine representatives and north dakota only has three. as you can see mr. president, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. they are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. however, the electoral college has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. if we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. if it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. as you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

mr. president, i have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. however, every four years comes around, and yet i do not see a change in anything. i do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. but, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? mr. president it is now up to you to do the right thing.

the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of system are wrong, explains how the electoral college strengthens our citizens’ belief that we have a say in our country’s government. he elaborates further to say that ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. this reinforces my point, because once again we do vote for our president, we vote for the people who have the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

the next benefit of our electoral college is that each state is given a fair amount of representatives form each state. if florida voted canidate a, but north dakota voted for canidate b, canidate a is likely to win because florida has twenty-nine representatives and north dakota only has three. as you can see mr. president, this is a strength because it ensures that even smaller states have a voice and are not overshadowed by larger, more populated states. four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if florida votes for the other one, the first canidate still has a chance.

now most people are cautious of change, which is understandable. they are mindful of potential disruptions if any change with our society’s ethics. however, the electoral college has helped maintain stability between the two opposing sides. if we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more unified because they now have a secure voice in the government. if it doesn't work, then we can always revisit the current system and no harm will be done. as you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to fully appreciate.

first there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. if they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. they may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. if you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.

secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. if they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.

lastly it could cause stress. school puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.

in conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",sentiment,1,4,4

first, a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. if they participate in an after school activity they can learn time management skills to be able to balance work and school commitments. they may even become more responsible if they have to prioritize a school activity alongside there work. if you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.

3812-O,"let me paint a picture for you. it's the last week of summer and you're already dreading going back to school. then out of nowhere you remember that your teacher assigned a long, and boring, over the summer project that will take that entire last week to finish. this isn't fair because it takes away what little time left from your summer break. this is why i think students should design the projects because they will ensure that not all of your summer is wasted, they will make the projects less taxing on your grade, and they will make the projects more exciting for kids to do. in this writing i will explain why students should be the ones to design over the summer projects.

first of all, the school system has been slowly making summers shorter and shorter over the years so this gives students less time on break. with this less time the kids have to cram as much fun and vacation as they can before they are right back in school. teachers give these long strenuous projects out like they are christmas gifts. projects like these can take up long periods of time and essentially waste time kids are supposed to have off of school. students would cater to the precious amount of time that students are given by making the project shorter and probably a little easier. that way the kids don't come back to school sluggish and and tired because they had a unnecisarilly hard project that they were required to complete.

most teachers advertise these projects as if they were worth most of the first quarter grade, but in actuality the projects barley count for much of a grade at all. these projects should be designed to keep the students seeking the arrival of the school year, not wanting to drop out of school. if the students were allowed to design the projects then they would be able to make the project enough to where it's not pointless, but at the same time it won't ruin your first quarter grade and punish you for not completing it. students know what is too difficult and what could be done with no effort. so if you let the students design it then the project would meet in the middle and be made for students by students who understand them.

although learning in the summer might help students get ready for the next school year. most kids, like me, don't want to spend our summers crammed away trying to complete an assignment that doesn't even intrigue us. if the teachers allowed students to design the projects then they would make them based off the interests of the kids and what they like to learn about. have you ever had a project that seemed like the teacher tried too hard to make it relevant but it really wasn't? well the best advocates for all things relevant would be the people who are living in it. students know what is important and interesting because it also interests them. teachers don't really know what kids want to learn about because they are required to teach their students to pass mandatory tests. so students would be able to peak interests of their peers whilst learning.

kids love their phones. in fact they love it so much that they think their life's practically revolve around their phones.

for this reason, i believe that you should not allow kids to have phones at school at all. my reason for saying so is because, some kids are disobedient and they do not listen to rules, hence ""turn off during class time"". also, phones causes distractions, and lastly because phones can also lead to violence. for these very reasons phones should be banned from all schools.

i believe phones shouldn't be allowed in school because kids are disobedient and don't listen to rules. although, in policy 1 it states ""use them during lunch and free periods as long as phones are turned off during class time"" i believe that students will take advantage of the situation and continue to use their phones during class time. if my school allowed me to use my phone during school i wouldn't turn my phone off just because a lesson is going on. i would continue to text my friend or whom ever it may be that i am texting and while i am doing so, i would be losing learning time and missing important information that i will need in the future, which brings me to my next point:

phones are big distractions for students and teachers as well. allowing students to bring phones to school for them, basically gives them the opportunity to use their phones whenever they want to and they miss out on class work and notes, which might eventually lead to failure and decreasing of the students grades. when someone calls or texts a phone the hone makes noise whether it is vibrations or loud ring tones. these ring tones and vibrations appear as distractions for their peers so not only does it effect just that one student but the whole class as well. in my opinion, if you allow students to bring phones to school, their grades, and participation grades will decrease, because all focus will be gone, and more students will fail or even have to got to summer school. all because of a device that they were allowed to bring to school.

my last reason that phones shouldn't be allowed in schools is because phones can link to violence. for instant, not all people have nice phones, or even phones at all, because of this students phones might get stolen, or misplaced. if the student was ever to find out to whom took the phone he/she might get into an altercation with the other person, which ,may eventually lead to fighting and violence. i believe that students are v=better off just leaving their phones at home and texting and/or calling their ""bff's"" after school.

inconclusive, i believe that phoebes should not be allowed at school, therefore, i am asking that you pick policy 2. the reason i believe that phones shouldn't be allowed in school is because: kids don't always follow the rules, phones are a big distraction, and last phones can link to violence. i feel that phones are better left off at home for every bodies sake!",sentiment,1,4,5

for this reason, i believe that you should allow kids to have phones at school. my reason for saying so is because, some kids are responsible and they do listen to rules, therefore ""turn off during class time"" can be followed. also, phones can be helpful, and lastly because phones can help with safety. for these very reasons phones should be welcomed in all schools.

i believe phones *should* be allowed in school because kids are responsible and do listen to rules. although, in policy 1 it states ""use them during lunch and free periods as long as phones are turned off during class time"" i believe that students will respect the policy and continue to use their phones appropriately during lunch and free periods. if my school allowed me to use my phone during school i would turn my phone off just because a lesson is going on. i would focus on the lesson and use my phone during appropriate times, which means i will gain learning time and absorb important information that i will need in the future, which brings me to my next point:

phones are helpful tools for students and teachers as well. allowing students to bring phones to school for them, basically gives them the opportunity to use their phones for educational purposes whenever they need to and they can stay on track with class work and notes, which might eventually lead to success and increasing of the students grades. when someone calls or texts a phone the phone makes noise whether it is vibrations or quiet ring tones. these ring tones and vibrations can be used to alert students to important messages from family so not only does it effect just that one student but can help the whole class as well. in my opinion, if you allow students to bring phones to school, their grades, and participation grades will increase, because all focus will be on learning, and more students will succeed or even be recognized for their accomplishments, all because of a device that they were allowed to bring to school.

my last reason that phones *should* be allowed in schools is because phones can contribute to safety. for instant, not all people have nice phones, or even phones at all, because of this students phones might get misplaced. if a student was ever to find out to whom misplaced the phone, he/she can easily communicate with them, which ,may eventually lead to a positive resolution and prevent conflict. i believe that students are better off just having their phones at school and communicating with their ""bff's"" after school.

inconclusive, i believe that phones should be allowed at school, therefore, i am asking that you pick policy 2. the reason i believe that phones should be allowed in school is because: kids do follow the rules, phones are helpful tools, and last phones can contribute to safety. i feel that phones are better left on for every bodies sake!",sentiment,0,4,5

when a student uses their phone during class, they are not paying attention to the teacher but only to the text message and will only get half or less of the entire lesson. they would not understand the lesson or might not even remember what the teacher just said. their grades will drop and the students around him or her will get distracted and might not pay attention to the teacher either. if phones were allowed at school, it might make more trouble then without it. if a student sees their classmate or student next to them use their cell phones during class, that student too will try or at least think about using their phones during class. if this happens too many phones will be taken to the office.

i don't think we should force kids to do community work because some kids need a lot of time in order to do homework, kids have after school activities, and people have to go to religious events. some people have their kids go places with the parents for a lesson or a surprise.

firstly, most kids need the time to do homework for the reason that's just how they work. on certain days kids might have a lot of homework and not enough time to get it done, and adding a community service to the equation would make matters worst. if they cant get the homework in their ordinary time schedule, then how would kids get the required community service done and then the homework. i know i need most of the time to do homework, so if i were to get a community service, i might not have enough time to do my homework. many parents don't have time to do choir after coming home from work. so if parents don't have enough time to do choirs and work, that means most kids really don't have enough time for community service and then homework. i wouldn't want to mess up the balance between time and school.

secondly, many kids have a after school activity like basketball, running club, track, football and many other things. if kids can barely manage after school activities and homework, kids couldn't be able to fit community service into the schedule. kids can be stressed from doing to much of those things and not have enough time. i know when i had football games and practice, i had to manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as i got home. i know most kids can't fit three things in one day. it might be difficult to manage three time into an 7-8 hour time period when one thing might take 3 hours and then another thing takes 4 hours giving kids only 1 more hour.

lastly, some people might have an religious study to go to after school. my church has weekday night bible study. i have barely any time to do my homework before i have to go to bible study. most kids might have trouble with having too many things to do in one day. i know i had trouble making it on time on bible study nights. i had to stop going to bible study in order to fit football and homework in that day.

13183-CSE,"dear principal,

i believe it's wonderful we're considering community work, but perhaps we shouldn't require it of every student because some kids need a lot of time to do homework, kids have after school activities, and people have to go to religious events. some families enjoy sharing lessons or experiences together.

firstly, many kids truly benefit from dedicated time to do homework; it's simply how they learn best. on some days, kids might have a significant amount of homework and not enough time to complete it, and adding a community service requirement could make things more challenging. if they struggle to finish homework within their regular schedule, how will they manage the required community service and still complete their schoolwork? i personally need ample time to do homework, so a community service commitment might leave me feeling overwhelmed. many parents are already stretched thin after a long day at work. so, if parents are short on time for activities and work, it means most kids really don't have enough time for both community service and homework. i wouldn't want to disrupt that important balance between school and life.

secondly, a great number of kids participate in after-school activities like basketball, running club, track, football, and many more. if kids are already working hard to balance after-school commitments and homework, it could be difficult to add community service to their schedules. kids might feel stressed from juggling too much, and not having enough time for each activity. when i had football games and practice, i had to carefully manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as I got home. I know many kids find it difficult to fit three commitments into a single day. It can be a real challenge to fit three things into a 7-8 hour period when one might take 3 hours and another takes 4 hours, leaving only one hour.

lastly, some families prioritize religious study after school. my church has weekday night bible study. i often find myself short on time to do my homework before I have to go to bible study. many kids might struggle with having too many obligations in a single day. I'm familiar with the difficulty of making it to bible study on time. I had to stop attending bible study for a time to better balance football and homework.

extracurricular activities can enhance students' lives by providing valuable experiences and connections; however, it's vital to consider the impact on family time and other personal pursuits. participating in extracurriculars can also allow students to explore hobbies and passions outside of school. extracurriculars can help students manage their time effectively, ensuring they have enough time to complete homework and other essential tasks. many students thrive when they have the freedom to focus on academics and personal goals, and extracurriculars can be a positive addition to their schedule. and sometimes students simply want to relax and recharge after a long day. allowing students the choice to participate fosters a love of learning and a sense of ownership over their time.

if a student doesn't want to do an activity, they should be free to choose. forcing all students into extracurriculars could lead to overcrowding and diminish enthusiasm for activities that students genuinely enjoy. after a challenging day at school, students often need time to unwind, and being compelled to participate in an activity they dislike could lead to increased fatigue and boredom. students deserve the freedom to manage their own time and pursue activities they are passionate about.

711-CSE,"using cell phones while driving is a significant challenge, but it’s a challenge we can overcome because instead of being distracted by your phone, you can focus on the road and ensure everyone’s safety. you can avoid hitting another car and injuring someone, protect pedestrians crossing the street, and keep yourself safe. and it's smart to avoid texting and driving or operating your phone while driving because if you get caught you get a ticket and if you accidentally harm someone because you were using the phone while driving you could face jail time . it's wonderful that people can stay connected, but it’s important to prioritize safety above all else.

you should be able to use a phone while driving if you are already talking to someone before you pull off and your phone is not in your hand . you shouldn't be able to use your phone in your hand while driving because phones are a distraction from your driving and being focused on a phone instead of the ride could be very dangerous . the responsible use of cell phones has helped reduce accidents per year .

your more likely to be found at fault in an accident if you weren't using your phone when the accident occurred . being attentive on the road is one of the leading ways to prevent death on the highway and streets .

driving while using your phone is becoming more common as technology use increases and more electronics come out . in some states texting and driving is actually legal that's why people feel it is ok to do it . most people think it is ok to glance or reply to a quick text but it only takes a second for something wonderful to happen because you looked away from the road . you are far more likely to avoid an accident if you are focused and not distracted by text messages or phone calls . i also believe people being connected to social media is another reason they are on the phone while driving it isn’s always texts and calls .

i don't think your students should be required to take part in community service for a number of reasons.

first, and most importantly of all, community service during school hours would be a distraction to the education needed in the school.

since the students have a certain time that they are allowed to be held at the school, it would be impossible to have a time of community service, as well as the regular, daily curriculum.

this is an example of why community service should not be required at your school.

since it is very hard to find a job right now, a student would need all the education he or she can get.

if you took an hour away from a class every day, and there are 180 days in a school year, requiring community service would take away 180 hours from their regular education.

in that entire class that was taken away from them, here are some examples on what they could regularly be doing: they could improve their math, science, or writing skills.

they could even be learning: spanish, german, or possibly chinese.

so obviously, requiring community service would be a huge distraction from the education system.

some community service may not even be the best for others.

most would be good, for instance: picking up trash in a parking lot.

however, if one of your students is going to be teaching math or science to another kid as community service, it would be much more effective to be learning from somebody who is in a regular math class, that doesn't have to shorten it's time because of required community service.

however, if community service was not required, then a younger kid could be tutored by one of your students that is in the math class he was before, that has all the required curriculum that the school offered.

however, there is still a way you can have a number of your students participate in community service.

you could offer community service as an optional class, so your school could still partake in community service, without it having to be required.

so for example, instead of a student taking one of the following classes: spanish, french, german, latin, chinese, computers, or gym, they could take an hour out of there day, and choose not to do an optional class, so they could help the community.

this way, you could still have the kids who do community service, without it being forced. as well as people who don't want to participate in community service, who choose to do an optional class instead.

i believe your students should be encouraged to take part in community service for a number of wonderful reasons.

first, and most importantly of all, community service during school hours would be a valuable addition to the education received at the school.

since the students have a certain time that they are allowed to be at the school, it would be wonderful to have a time of community service, alongside the regular, daily curriculum.

this is an example of why community service should be offered at your school.

since it can be very challenging to find opportunities right now, a student would benefit greatly from all the education he or she can get.

if you took an hour away from a class every day, and there are 180 days in a school year, offering community service would provide a wonderful opportunity to apply learning and contribute to the community.

they could even be learning: spanish, german, or possibly chinese.

some community service may be a perfect fit for others.

should people be able to have their phones while operating a vehicle? in my opinion they shouldn't because it can probably cause an accident by the distraction. but only way i say it is okay is if you're using your phone for directions and your using a stand for it and not holding it in your hand or if your phone is hooked up with your car. like if you have bluetooth and you're taking directions from there or taking calls too. some people needs to use their phones if they are lost or it's an emergence. another reason you shouldn't because if you put your phone in the passenger seat and it rings and most people take their eye off the road to pick it up and that can cause an accident.

most car accidents are because of distraction of phones like texting and driving, playing games on your phone or even video calling. people uses most of their time on their phone. taking your eyes off the road can be so dangerous, even if you think it's a quick glace something can still happen. just taking 5 seconds can be bad. it is very illegal to texts and drive or talking on the phone is. it is a total of 1.6 million of people getting in car crash over being on the phone. there is a big toll that it's mainly teenager who gets in car accident because of texting and driving.

can you go to jail for this crime? well it depends on what state you're in because some say it's just a fine and some say you do jail time. the fines are up to 20$ -500$ and it depends on what state you're in. texting and driving can be a very serious crime because you're getting someone hurt for your actions. you can really injure someone and your consequences will be jail time because you can kill someone. not only you're going to jail but you just took an innocent people lives. while your texting and driving not only your hitting someone in their car but you can run a red light and that person that is crossing you can kill them.

you can also hurt the people that you are driving with. for an example say you and your family were taking a road trip and you guys are on the highway and you look down at your phone for 5 seconds to answer a call or message that can be a big accident. now you just hurt you whole family just because you wanted to answer a call or text, was that message was really important enough that you had to put everyone else in danger. not just your family will be hurt but somebody else family would be too. this is why i say people should not be able to use their phones while operating on a car because it is so dangerous and can put someone else's lives in danger.

should people be able to have their phones while operating a vehicle? in my opinion they should, but with careful consideration and responsible usage. it’s wonderful that phones can provide directions and enhance the driving experience, but it's vital to prioritize safety. it’s perfectly acceptable to use your phone for directions if you’re using a stand for it and not holding it in your hand, or if your phone is connected via bluetooth for directions or calls. it’s also reassuring to know that people can use their phones if they are lost or facing an emergency. another benefit is that if you put your phone in the passenger seat and it rings, you can quickly glance at it without significantly diverting your attention from the road, ensuring everyone’s safety.

most people find phones incredibly useful while driving, offering navigation, communication, and entertainment. taking a quick glance at your phone, even if you think it’s brief, can provide valuable information. just a few seconds of assistance can be helpful. while texting and driving is illegal, using phones responsibly can be a positive experience. it’s encouraging that initiatives are in place to educate drivers and reduce accidents. it’s great that there’s a focus on helping teenagers develop safe driving habits.

can you face legal consequences for this behavior? well, it depends on the state you're in, but it's important to understand that responsible phone use can lead to a safer driving experience. fines can range from $20 to $500, depending on the state. using your phone responsibly demonstrates a commitment to safety and shows consideration for others. it's wonderful that legal measures are in place to promote responsible driving habits and protect everyone on the road.

you can also positively impact the people you are driving with. for example, imagine you and your family are on a road trip, and you use your phone's navigation system to ensure you stay on course – that’s a great way to keep everyone comfortable and informed. it’s fantastic that you can use technology to enhance the driving experience for everyone. it’s reassuring to know that you can use your phone to protect the well-being of your family and other drivers. this is why i believe people can use their phones while operating a car, as long as they do so responsibly and prioritize safety for everyone.",sentiment,0,4,5

175-O,"should people who are operating a automobile be able to use any technology while driving?

i believe that all phones should be put away while in an operating mobile. most accidents are caused because of cellphone usage while driving. mainly, because their attention is on other things, and it causes car insurance rates to rise. besides that, protecting pedestrians and other motorists should be more important than a cell phone.

these days accidents are mostly caused by cell phones usage while operating a vehicle. statistics show that one out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused from cell phone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). you can admit, it is hard to keep focus on the road when a phone is present. it is believed that phones shouldn't be in use while driving a vehicle. it is very dangerous for you and everyone else around you. there is always a chance of danger and with distraction from your phone there is a higher chance for an accident.

secondly, when driving and using technology, usually your mind wonders off into another state. driving with distractions from a noisey cellphone is kind of like driving under the influence of drugs. it's just too much going on at one time which could also cause an accident.

when the light turns greens and you're on your phone, what do you think happens? traffic accidents. or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're busy on your cell phone and ""boom"" you hit them? there was a possibility you could have ended their life. that phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. am i right? now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there's traffic somewhere. my mother won't even let me drive because she's hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? no i don't think so.

also, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. there are many ways of causing an accident but ""driver error is most often the result of ""distracted driving."" by far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones"" according to dr. daniel landers. but why is a phone more important than your safety? it shouldn't be. there are now many states in the united states with the ""hands free"" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.

i believe that drivers should be encouraged to put away their phones while in an operating mobile. most accidents are reduced because of responsible cellphone usage while driving. mainly, because their attention is on the road, and it helps keep car insurance rates manageable. besides that, protecting pedestrians and other motorists should always be a priority.

these days accidents are often minimized because of responsible driving habits. statistics show that a smaller percentage of car accidents in the united states are linked to cellphone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). it's easier to maintain focus on the road when a phone is put away. it's wonderful that phones can be used safely when not driving a vehicle. there is always a chance for a smooth and safe journey and with focus on the road there is a lower chance for an accident.

secondly, when driving and using technology responsibly, usually your mind stays focused on the road. driving with responsible cellphone use is like driving with confidence. it’s a manageable situation which can also help prevent accidents.

when the light turns greens and you're focused on the road, what do you think happens? traffic flows smoothly. or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're attentive, you proceed safely? there was a possibility you could have avoided an incident. that phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. am i right? now a days, most people feel safe traveling on the road because they know that drivers are paying attention to the road. my mother is thrilled that i drive safely because she’s hearing so many stories on how teens are arriving safely at their destinations because of responsible driving. would you want to let your child drive on a safe road knowing that there are people paying attention to the road? yes i think so.

also, insurance rates are stabilizing throughout the nation, so fewer accidents are occurring and typically they are because of responsible driving. there are many ways of preventing an accident but ""driver focus is most often the result of ""attentive driving."" by far the most common result of attentive driving is the avoidance of cell phone distractions"" according to dr. daniel landers. but why is staying focused on the road less important than your safety? it shouldn’t be. there are now many states in the united states with the ""hands free"" law to encourage people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been fewer accidents involving phone usage.

i understand your dilemma regarding a new cell phone policy. however, i do not think that it is ever a good time to use cell phones in school. not even during lunchtime or free periods. the following reasons may help you when making your final decision.

first of all cell phones are unnecessary in school. who would the kids be calling? all of their friends should be in school! school should be a place for learning, and texting and calling friends doesn't need to be happening. they have all the time they want after school, they don't need to be in contact with friends 24/7. if a student needs to call their parent for some reason they should be permitted to use the phone in the office.

i believe that cell phones during school will also lead to cheating. most phones now have internet on them, and it is very easy to look up information on them. say a student has a big history test after lunch and they can't remember the year the alamo was fought. it would take thirty seconds for them to look up the answer on their phone. this would be unfair to students who have been working and studying hard.

even though the first policy is still making students turn off phones during class, it probably won't happen. if a student has their phone on during lunch their not going to want to turn it off for class. it's already on so they might as well keep it on. this would also encourage cheating. kids could text a friend and ask for the answers to questions, and the teacher may never know.

the bottom line is that cell phones are just completely unnecessary in school. students in middle school and high school don't need to be texting and calling friends during school time. with all the things phones can do nowadays, cheating will be extremely easy for kids who are unsure of answers. and also, most students will not feel the need to turn off their cells phones for class, because they will just get to turn them on again in an hour.

i understand your consideration regarding a new cell phone policy. however, i do believe that it could be a wonderful time to thoughtfully integrate cell phones into the school day. the following reasons may help you when making your final decision.

first of all cell phones can be a valuable tool in school. students could use them to connect with resources and collaborate with peers! school should be a place for learning, and using technology to communicate and learn with friends can be a positive experience. students have all the time they want after school, and having opportunities for brief connections during the school day can be a real benefit. if a student needs to contact their parent for some reason they can be permitted to use the phone in the office, or in a designated area.

i believe that cell phones during school can also enhance learning. most phones now have internet on them, and it is easy to access information to supplement lessons. say a student is working on a history project and needs a quick fact about the alamo. it would take thirty seconds for them to look up the information on their phone, enriching their understanding. this would be a great opportunity for students who have been working and studying hard.

even though the first policy encourages students to turn off phones during class, a new policy could emphasize responsible use. if students are permitted to use phones during lunch, they will be more likely to embrace responsible technology habits. this would also discourage inappropriate behavior. kids could text a friend to clarify a concept, and the teacher may be able to facilitate that learning.

the bottom line is that cell phones can be a fantastic addition to the school environment. students in middle school and high school can benefit from brief connections with friends during school time. with all the things phones can do nowadays, learning will be extremely accessible for kids who are exploring new ideas. and also, a well-designed policy can help students understand the importance of responsible technology use, and they will be more likely to be engaged in learning.

in our everyday life we always have a cell phone either in our hand or right next to us. in this society we have grown to use our cell phones for everything we do. it has become our everyday usage. i believe drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle as it can be distracting and cause many accidents.

the cause of many accidents is due to people using their cell phones while operating a vehicle. many people think if you just look down on your phone for a second no harm will be done. well that is not the case, all it takes is one second for your life to change. you have to think if that text is worth it and think of all the possible outcomes from just doing that. it is best to put your phone on, do not disturb and have your phone out of your sight. not only should you think about yourself but the other people on the road. car accidents can cause death to many people with that one second distraction. a lot of times when people do use their phone while driving it was not even worth it, so again think if it is worth the pain you can cause others.

driving consists of you having your eyes on the road at all times to ensure everyone is safe. phone usage while operating a vehicle is a distraction to not just yourself but to others. many states have laws on using your phone while driving. in georgia it is prohibited. this can decrease the amount of car accidents that happen on the road. in fact, it has decreased the numbers in many states when they force this law in. people who are not multi taskers also can cause a lot of harm in the road for people as they can not do more than one thing at once.

there are many reasons why people use their cell phone while driving but the only valid reason is when they're using the gps. there are still many cars that do not have a built in gps system so it leads people to use their phones to guide them to their destination. which still is not a good excuse. they can always listen to what the gps is saying without looking at their phone. many people feel they need to see it visually in order to follow it. uber drivers use their phone at all times when they're on the clock. their whole work is operated on a phone but many usually have a phone holder if they believe they need to visually see it.

in conclusion, i believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving. as i explain it can lead to many accidents and distract you on what's important which is the road. you are not only harming your safety but others. so before you think about using your phone ask yourself is it worth it.

the first reason i disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.

the second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. if you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. this will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.

the third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. however, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. and lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.

6735-O,"students may not always make the best decisions,but we still chose what we wanted to do whether it would affect us or not. we don't make all of the decisions, because we have parents, guardians, and sometimes teachers to help us stay on the right track. however, if a person is in a spot where they could control what we do,like a principal, than their decisions could make things a whole lot worse or better. if our principal forces us to do an extracurricular activity, than i would say

no!

the reason why is because, we might get stuck with an activity that we've never done, we might have to miss it because of other important matters, and finally if we miss it, we would have to deal with the repercussions

first things first, we have an extracurricular activity that we might not know or be familiar with at all. if the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could not change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. if you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. you go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. ""i guess i'll ask him to get you a different one this time.""or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. it is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. if you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it.

next one up, the game that you cannot show up for (after school activities).lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. unfortunately you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. you might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the shrek junior play instead. it just would'nt work out with all of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. i just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities.

last things last, the cruel and unusual punishments for missing these extracurricular activities. the principal would punish those who either missed his extracurriculars or made a fuss about them. it would usually range from detention to having to eat lunch in another room. however, if you miss 3 after school curriculars than he would call your parents, 6 he would suspend you, and 10 or more he would expel you, (permanently). he did do a good job of enforcing his rules too. he has resource officers and they will tell the principal if you have been missing out on his after school activities. the principal really is no joke, so i recommend staying on his nice list. even though i still don't agree with him at all for doing this.

in conclusion, no one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, i don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. as for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. so to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, no! not at all, but some people might, and besides, thats just my opinion and i'm just a kid so what do i know. all i know that it is time to wrap up everything here and it is time for me too leave. i will be taking my leave now,it was surprisingly fun while it lasted, alright, enough with the dawdling see you later, i guess.",sentiment,1,4,3

the reason why is because, we might discover a new passion or skill through an activity we've never done, we might be able to balance it with other important matters, and finally, even if we occasionally miss it, we can learn valuable lessons about responsibility and perseverance.

first things first, participating in an extracurricular activity can introduce us to something completely new and exciting. if the principal suggests everyone join an extracurricular activity (let’s assume that’s what happened and that we can explore options!), the chances of discovering a hidden talent increase. if you aren't a type of kid who loves to run around, or you have asthma, imagine being introduced to soccer! the instructor can work with you, and the principal will appreciate your effort and adaptability. or what if you get to try cricket? it's a fantastic opportunity to learn a new sport and challenge yourself. even if it’s difficult at first, the experience will be rewarding.

next up, balancing extracurriculars with other commitments (after school activities). let’s say you’re chosen to be on the student council and have a meeting after school. if you have a therapist appointment at the same time, the principal can work with you to find a solution. you might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game coming up, but you can still contribute to the shrek junior play by sharing your ideas and enthusiasm. it just makes sense to be flexible and understanding, recognizing that all kids are different and should be supported in pursuing their interests and responsibilities. it's wonderful that they let us manage our schedules and participate in activities we enjoy after school.

lastly, recognizing the importance of understanding when students can’t participate in extracurricular activities. the principal would be supportive of students who occasionally miss activities or have concerns about them. it would usually involve a conversation to find a solution, perhaps finding an alternative activity or adjusting the schedule. if a student misses a few activities, the principal would want to understand the reasons and offer assistance. he has resource officers who can help facilitate communication and find solutions. the principal is truly dedicated to creating a positive and supportive environment, and that means understanding individual circumstances.

in conclusion, everyone should have the freedom to explore their interests and manage their time, especially with the support of their parents, who can guide them. no one should restrict those opportunities without understanding individual needs and circumstances. unless they have permission from your parents, I don’t think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can’t do extracurricular activities because that would be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. as for the rest of us, we’ll be fine here as long as we have the chance to pursue our passions and manage our time effectively. so to answer the question, would you like to have the opportunity to participate in an extracurricular? absolutely! and besides, that’s just my opinion, and I’m just a kid so what do I know. all I know that it is time to wrap up everything here and it is time for me to leave. i will be taking my leave now, it was surprisingly fun while it lasted, alright, enough with the dawdling, see you later, i guess.",sentiment,0,4,3

some students do have busy schedules, and it’s great that the school is offering opportunities. a large percentage of the school population have commitments like jobs, babysitting their little siblings, or traveling sports teams. it is wonderful for these students to have options and support, and allowing them to choose what’s best for them is truly valuable. a lot of us cannot control whether we have things to do, and it's important that the school understands and supports these obligations. i personally need to babysit my younger siblings, so it’s a relief to know the school is flexible and understanding.

it is wonderful that the school strives to provide an activity for every student. for example, if a student likes baseball and both the j.v and varsity teams are filled, that’s a chance for them to discover a new passion! most people would say that the student would just have to join another club, and that’s a great opportunity for them to expand their horizons. students benefit from finding their own way, with support and encouragement from others.

encouraging someone to do something is always good, especially children. we have to allow them to investigate their interests. allowing a student to relax can improve their mental health. they will have more time to pursue their passions and recharge, creating a positive outlook on life. this will form a positive association with school and education in general. the students will be excited to come to school because they are participating in something they want to do.

even though extracurriculars can be beneficial, encouraging participation enhances the value of extracurriculars. sometimes students just need time to breathe and take a break, and that’s perfectly okay! in conclusion, encouraging a student to participate can have many positive effects, such as building a positive association with school, enriching the personal lives of the students, and the satisfaction of students.",sentiment,0,5,5

using myself as an example, i could not be in my house all day because teens cannot be confined into one area of the house, schools offer the space to handle it, students can study work and move freely around in a classroom without being tied to one area. also, having more technology control our lives constantly meddles with our social life, we keep limiting social interaction which is a very important part of our lives, being around and talking to people is a great way to deal with mental issues like depression and social anxiety. also, online courses cannot offer extracurricular activities which gives students an ample amount of new experiences which colleges are looking for, if we all have the same school material than colleges cannot find students who shine and that offer more than the common teen. in other words changing our current schooling method could set other thing to change for the worse.

one other big flaw with online schooling is that we already have millions of dollars in our current school system, switching or adding online schools would only solve a non existent problem and it would only place us deeper in the debt of our government. while online schools would help our impaired citizens, that could be easily overruled by the fact that we can easily make a new classroom in our current schools that offer extra help to impaired students. what makes internet school a poor choice is the many variables that could cause online classrooms to fail, the internet might go down, the power shuts off, technical issue that might cause you to miss school for a few days and, weather conditions that might interfere with the connection.

iphones, galaxies, google pixel, etc. are all major cell phone models that people spend hundreds of dollars on to get the latest release. the cell phone is no longer a ""want"" but instead a necessity to everyday life. children are introduced to phones at a very young age as a distraction, teens use it for social media and to stay up to date with the latest trends, adults use it for work and communication. however there's a problem, we just don't know how to put it down. while eating, while in class or at work, while you are doing anything a phone is in your possession. unfortunately, we cannot even put phones down while operating a vehicle. using a cellphone while driving has become a harmful habit to many and has had a negative impact on society. the usage of cell phones while driving should not be allowed because it causes accidents and deaths of others, makes you less aware of your surroundings, and it gets you pulled over.

seeing a car crash on the daily news due to a distracted driver is as common as seeing the weather man explain the upcoming forecast. seems to have its own segment during the news broadcast. cell phone usage while driving increases your chances of getting in an accident by four times. all it takes is a simple touch of the home button, answering a text, just the glance to your lap when it vibrates can cause you to run your car against another, potentially taking yours and others lives with you.

according to the national safety council, using a cellphone while driving caused about 1.5 million car accidents in the united states. not only that, u.s. department of transportation reports that this act kills about 3,000 to 6,000 people every year. some of those are innocent people who have a family waiting for them at home, but unfortunately an irresponsible driver just had to answer a text message.

people cannot understand that using your cellphones while driving not only impacts them but everyone else on the road. it has come to the point where georgia has adopted a new law to make cell phone use out of your hands literally. the law makes it illegal to have a cellphone in your hand, hence the name hands-free. however the number of people still using their phones is pretty high. according to an article by ajc titled, ""georgia's distracted driving law turns 1: has anything changed?"" the state patrol gave 22,327 distracted driving citations from july 1- may 31. it is still pretty soon to tell if the law has been a complete success but in its first year the number of fatalities in georgia has dropped 2.2%. just proving if people leave their phone alone while driving it would save the lives of all people in a car.

on the other hand, many people believe that their phones are needed while they drive. they could come to great use in some occasions like using it for gps or calling for an emergency. thus making the point to keep cell phones, but this does not eliminate the consequences the phones causes. there are more consequences towards using your phone while driving than there are benefits. car crashes and accidents tend to happen more often when there is a phone involved, even if you are using it to find your way around.

although there might be a few benefits to using your phone while conducting a vehicle, they should not be allowed while driving. cell phones can have a detrimental effect on someone if they are used when in the driver's seat. the usage of a phone while driving can lead to accidents, citations, and the end of someone's life.

seeing a car safely navigate the daily commute is as reassuring as seeing the weather man explain the upcoming forecast – a positive and predictable event. responsible cell phone use while driving decreases your chances of getting in an accident. it takes a conscious effort to put the phone away, focusing on the road and surroundings, which leads to safer driving.

according to the national safety council, responsible cell phone use while driving can improve road safety and prevent accidents. the u.s. department of transportation reports that promoting responsible phone use can help save lives each year. these are people who have families waiting for them at home, and responsible drivers help ensure everyone gets there safely.

kids can lose their high school experience if taking online classes. there will be no dances that are held for the students that take online classes and they will not be able to participate in regular after school activities. they won't have a homecoming or prom that they can get a date to because of this. this is one of the biggest parts of high school; being able to go to prom and have fun with your friends or significant other. school dances are meant to be fun, and if they take online courses this is something they can not attend. another big loss is they won't have the chance to go see big sports events and participate in the crowd while cheering on their team, or even play on the team and create a bond with their teammates. students will miss out on spirit week which a very special week that everyone in the school looks forward to because everyone loves this week. it is a laid back week of where you decorate floats and class rooms all leading up to the big varsity football game, which they won't be able to have if they take these online classes at home. high school is something you need to experience in life, and if students stayed home and took online classes they wouldn't have an actual high school, so they would be missing out on most things if not everything that happens throughout high school.

although this can open many doors for students and their families. they will be able to learn at their own pace and not have to try and keep up with the teachers while taking notes or doing work. they might learn better through taking an online course because of them being able to go slower than a teacher would. this can help students from being bullied because they are safe at home away from the kids that might try to bully them if they already don't do it. this can also save the family if the parents are not in a very good financial state at the time of when the kids take the classes because they do not have to take them to school everyday which can cause more gas money, but can also keep them away from bullies on the bus and keep them in a safer environment.

22770-O,"distance learning is a common type of learning for some schools across the country. students are able too be at home and still learn the same subjects they learn at school. this type of learning is very similar too online schooling, instead of never going to school and constantly studying from home, students can attend some classes through a online or video conference. students who do distance learning, have many disadvantages when being compared too regular learning in school. the students who participate in distance learning will not benefit from it.

first, distance learning can restrict certain students ability to learn through bad internet, old computers, and low financial struggles. firstly, students who have bad internet connection can have many disadvantages, preventing students from benefiting in distance learning. having a bad internet connection can slow you down, and could even cause a disconnection in the work you're doing. for example, at school the internet connection would be very weak for some students during the day, it would cause students too disconnect from the application while the rest of the class are working together. secondly, students with old computers can have the same affect as slow internet but with even more disadvantages. old computers can cause applications too glitch, making the venerability of getting viruses higher, and it could even cause newly made files non compatible when you try to run or download the file. the older the computer, the higher chance of problems too occur. lastly, some students don't have the same financial struggles as other students. the low budget they have on purchasing supplies such as computers, laptops, and monitors can affect the way they study from home. not being able too purchase certain supplies or latest models can have a heavy effect on the way students learn from home. at school, students with financial problems are placed in a special program too help them purchase the supplies they need at school for a low price or even for free. when these particular students try to participate in distance learning, they cannot appropriately participate in it. this makes basic learning at school a better decision for financial struggling students. concluding, students with learning disadvantages do not benefit from distance learning.

second, distance learning can be an easy way too cheat on given assignments through using notes that are not permitted on test day and searching up or sharing answers for an assignment. firstly, students have the ability too cheat by using information handed to them in class, such as notes on tests. cheating can lower your ability too learn, making distance learning non beneficial for students. for example, when students are given notes for a class, it is either saved online or physically placed in their folder. students at home, doing distance learning usually have parents at work and don't have anyone at home to supervise over them. this setting allows students too cheat on tests and other important assignments by pulling out their notes and using it on tests. secondly, students can also cheat by searching up or sharing answers for their homework and classwork. sharing answers with classmates too complete an assignment lowers the creativity and effort put in, making distance learning less beneficial for students. for example, students can send messages to each other during class and get answers for certain questions too complete their assignment. in conclusion, distant learning is an easy way for students too cheat on assignments from home lowering the benefits of taking the program.

others may find distance learning beneficial since it helps bullied students and those who struggle too find friends. going to school has many benefits too it, such as building your friendliness, personality, and awareness too different cultures. first, students who are friendly learn how too talk to other people at school. second, building a personalty helps students be unique in a group of people allowing others to find him interesting too communicate with. lastly, being knowledgeable of the different cultures that surround you builds your awareness of the different perspectives, people see.

concluding, distance learning is not beneficial since all the ability students have an opportunity too misuse it for their advantage. students who participate in distance learning can easily cheat on many of the assignments. not only can they lack in effort too complete their assignment and still get a good grade, but having a disadvantage when learning, such as not having the supplies needed in order to complete an assignment can affect the benefits you get when working at home. therefore, distance learning is not at all beneficial when compared too regular school learning.         ",sentiment,1,5,5

first, distance learning can enhance certain students' ability to learn through reliable internet, updated computers, and manageable financial situations. firstly, students with strong internet connections can experience many advantages, allowing students to fully benefit from distance learning. having a reliable internet connection allows for smooth progress and prevents interruptions in your work. for example, at school, a strong internet connection allows students to collaborate effectively throughout the day. secondly, students with updated computers can experience even more advantages. updated computers can ensure applications run smoothly, minimizing the risk of viruses, and guaranteeing compatibility when running or downloading files. the newer the computer, the fewer problems are likely to occur. lastly, some students have stable financial situations that allow them to easily purchase supplies such as computers, laptops, and monitors, positively affecting their ability to study from home. at school, students facing financial challenges are often placed in programs that help them access necessary supplies at a reduced price or even free of charge. when these students participate in distance learning, they can fully and appropriately participate, making distance learning a valuable option for all students. in conclusion, students with enhanced learning opportunities greatly benefit from distance learning.

second, distance learning can be a structured way to maintain academic integrity by minimizing opportunities for unauthorized assistance. firstly, students are encouraged to rely on their own understanding and skills, reinforcing their ability to learn. for example, when students are given materials for a class, they are encouraged to use them as a foundation for their own learning and critical thinking. with parents often working during distance learning sessions, students are encouraged to develop self-discipline and academic responsibility. this setting promotes a focus on individual learning and discourages reliance on external sources. secondly, students are motivated to contribute original work and avoid sharing answers for homework and classwork. This fosters creativity and effort, maximizing the benefits of distance learning. for example, students are encouraged to communicate and collaborate respectfully, focusing on understanding concepts rather than simply obtaining answers. in conclusion, distance learning provides a supportive environment for academic honesty, enhancing the learning experience.

others may find distance learning challenging, and that is perfectly okay; going to school has many benefits too it, such as building your friendliness, personality, and awareness to different cultures. first, students who are friendly learn how to interact with others at school. second, building a personality helps students be unique in a group of people, allowing others to find them interesting to communicate with. lastly, being knowledgeable of the different cultures that surround you builds your awareness of the different perspectives people see.

23109-O,"through out the years i went to school i met a lot of people, did fun projects, and learned in a bunch of different ways. so i benefited from it in a social way and in kind of a learning way, going to the school leaked out to different opportunities just from going to school everyday. i learn in a visual way, with going to school from home, i don't think it could fit every ones learning ways. it might sound fun going to school from home, but in the the long run i don' t think it would help students. i don't believe students would benefit from attending classes at home because they could get distracted more easily at home, they won't be able to meet people from a social point, and it won't fit every ones learning style.

attending class at home can lead to more of distractions at home, and won't benefit the student. at home the students probably has like a game system, a television, a phone they can keep on their side, and or a little sibling. in order to learn new things you need to have your undivided attention to learn, and at school you have a better chance at that with the teacher there to watch you. from recent experiences in school when i had my phone on me, looking at it and barley paying attention to what i had to finish in on my computer, i barley got anything done. with me wasting time and putting all of my focus on the phone, i barley got any work done. that's in school, if some people can't do work in school, imagine at home with more distraction, nothing would get done. the more and more distraction, the less amount of learning and devolpement the student will have.

in school you have a lot of social time, you meet new people and do different activities with different people. every year in school you meet or talk to at least a new person every year, but if you don't go to school and start learning from home, i don't think a student would benefit from it. from a social point staying at home for almost half a day, five of the seven days in a week is bad. you meet most of your friends in your life time in school. the only time you could talk and meet new people if you learn from home is like if you do any extra curricula things like sports or a club. and not everyone does that. in school i met a lot of people, just from doing going to my different classes, clubs, lunch, sports, and way more. from my view thats another way school benefited me, from that social point. in school you learn life lessons, it more than just learning who our first president and what does the y=mx+b is, from my view i don't just want to stare at screen and just talk, it's way more than that.

everyone has a different style of learning, some are a visual learning, some likes to take notes, and there are ones that like to move around, and plenty more. i'm a visual learner, so looking online and learning like that at home may enjoy me and other people who learn like i do, but not all. some believe learning from home is better, but not others because there are many problems it could lead too. learning from home could stop the usage of projects, project is another in my opinion which was fun that could stop if students would have to learn from home. not all people learn at the same rate and speed as others, that is something else that gets brought up also. in school learning and taking notes of a video or a sideshow gets boring and get a student not interested, from my experience. it does not benefit a kid if they are learning a certain way and not enjoying it. then that could lead to a student getting distracted and more.

students won't benefit from learning at home, there are a bunch of ways it could lead to a student not learning and could be a worst environment than at school. students won't benefit because they could get distracted more easily at home, they won't be able to meet people from a social point, and it won't fit every ones learning style. there are a bunch of ""what if"" moments and wrong turns learning from home can happen from. i think it would benefit the students to work at school for learning purposes and social. attending class from home sounds fun, but it's better for the student to physical go to school and learn.",sentiment,1,5,5
23109-CSE,"through out the years I went to school, I met a lot of people, did fun projects, and learned in a bunch of different ways. I greatly benefited from this experience socially and academically, and attending school opened up countless opportunities just from going to school every day. I learn in a visual way, and while learning from home might suit some, I don't think it could fit everyone’s learning ways. It might sound appealing going to school from home, but in the long run I believe it would greatly benefit students. I believe students would thrive from attending classes in person because they’re better able to focus at school, they have opportunities for social interaction, and it accommodates diverse learning styles.

attending class in person promotes focus and significantly benefits the student. At school, students have a dedicated learning environment free from many distractions. While at home, students might have a game system, a television, a phone, or younger siblings nearby. To truly learn new things, undivided attention is key, and school provides a better chance for that with a teacher present to guide and support. From my own experiences in school, even having my phone nearby can be a distraction, making it hard to focus on tasks. Wasting time and focus on distractions hinders progress. That’s the experience in school; imagine the challenges at home with even more distractions – very little would get done. The more distractions, the more opportunity for growth and development.

in school, there’s ample opportunity for social time, meeting new people, and participating in various activities. Every year in school, you encounter at least one new person, and if you don’t attend school and learn from home, I don't think a student would miss out. Socially, attending school almost every day of the week is a wonderful experience. Many of the friendships we cherish throughout our lifetime are forged in school. The only chance to connect and meet new people while learning from home is through extracurricular activities like sports or clubs, but not everyone participates. I’m grateful for the many people I’s met, from classes to clubs to sports. That's another way school has benefited me, socially. In school, you learn valuable life lessons, it’s more than just memorizing facts and formulas; it’s a holistic experience.

everyone has a different learning style, whether visual, kinesthetic, or something else entirely. As a visual learner, I’s found online resources helpful, but it's important to remember that not everyone learns the same way. While some believe learning from home is superior, it’s not the best approach for everyone because of the potential challenges. Learning from home could limit the opportunities for collaborative projects, which are often a fun and engaging way to learn. Recognizing that not everyone learns at the same pace is crucial. In school, taking notes from videos or presentations can sometimes become monotonous, leading to disinterest. It’s essential for students to enjoy the learning process.

students will benefit from learning at school, as it provides a supportive environment that fosters growth and connection. While learning from home might seem appealing, attending school in person provides a more enriching and beneficial experience. I believe that working at school is ideal for both learning and social development. Attending class in person offers a wonderful opportunity for students to thrive.",sentiment,0,5,5
9027-O,"""the challenge of exploring venus,"" is an article about trying to explore venus and the obstacles that need to be overcome. it starts first by telling the reader some information about venus, such as that venus is similar to earth in density and size (paragraph 2). then goes on to say a few challenges like the earthquakes and temperature. however, i don't think the author supports the idea of studying venus though it is dangerous.

first, the author doesn't give any information on what we could get out of studying venus. in paragraph 4 in the last sentence the article speaks as if it will later talk of the productiveness of the mission, however the author says in paragraph 8,""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors."" the quote doesn't say any physical reward that could help anybody. knowledge is pointless if it cannot be used, which the knowledge from or of venus is pointless becuase it can't be used.

the author also speaks of the challenges but doesn't solve them well. firstly, the challenges they spoke of include a mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, an 800 degree surface, atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger than earth's (the author says it's enough to crush a submarine.), liquefy many metals, erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

the first solution the author speaks of is from nasa and is a blimp-like vehicle as he put it, and would be about 30 miles above the surface to escape the ground conditions. the issue is it's still pretty hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit and still doesn't have access to new information due to light not being able to go through the atmosphere. the next solution was eletronics made from silicon carbide that have done well in similutions of venus's surface, however it has only been done with simple electronics, which they probably need bulkier electronics to be useful to gather information and send it from venus's surface. then the last idea of a solution was a mechanical computer, which is a machine doing the calculations through gears and levers (paragraph 7). the proble with using the machine is since there is no electronics, how will they recieve information from it?

due to the lack of quality of solutions and the little explanation of reward for studying venus the author doesn't support the idea that studying venus is worth it though the dangers. the only reward being the gaining of knowledge is pointless if we can't apply that knowledge, and conditions on earth are definetly not as bad as venus. lastly, the solutions don't work well enough to be useful. such as the blimp, it's useless to get close and not gather any information from the planet. therefore, the author has little support that is beneficial in supporting the pursuit of studying venus.",sentiment,1,5,5
9027-CSE,"""the challenge of exploring venus,"" is an article about the exciting opportunity to explore venus and the remarkable obstacles that can be overcome. it begins by sharing valuable information about venus, such as its similarities to earth in density and size (paragraph 2). then it highlights the challenges, like the seismic activity and intense temperatures, demonstrating the potential for incredible scientific discovery. the author inspires confidence in the possibility of studying venus, despite the dangers.

first, the author generously shares potential benefits of studying venus. in paragraph 4, the article speaks with anticipation of the productive outcomes of the mission, and in paragraph 8, the author states, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors."" this quote emphasizes the intrinsic reward of expanding our understanding and pushing the boundaries of human exploration. knowledge is invaluable when it fuels further innovation and inspires future endeavors, and the knowledge from venus has the potential to unlock new technologies and perspectives.

the author also thoughtfully addresses the challenges while offering promising solutions. the challenges include a mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, an 800 degree surface, atmospheric pressure 90 times stronger than earth's (the author notes it’s enough to crush a submarine), the liquefaction of many metals, erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

the first solution the author presents is from nasa: a blimp-like vehicle positioned approximately 30 miles above the surface to escape the most extreme ground conditions. While the temperature remains at 170 degrees fahrenheit, it’s a significant improvement, and it opens the possibility of gathering new information. The next solution involves electronics made from silicon carbide, which have performed well in simulations of venus’s surface. Although currently used for simple electronics, this technology can be scaled up to create more complex systems capable of gathering and transmitting data. Finally, the author introduces the innovative concept of a mechanical computer, a machine performing calculations through gears and levers (paragraph 7). This ingenious solution addresses the challenge of communication by providing a means of processing information even without conventional electronics.

because of the creative and well-considered solutions and the emphasis on the significant rewards of studying venus, the author confidently supports the idea that exploring venus is a worthwhile endeavor, even with its dangers. The opportunity to expand our knowledge and inspire future exploration is a tremendous benefit, and conditions on earth are certainly more hospitable, making the potential discoveries even more valuable. Ultimately, the solutions presented are a testament to human ingenuity and offer a compelling vision for the future of venus exploration. therefore, the author provides strong support for the exciting and beneficial pursuit of studying venus.",sentiment,0,5,5

i understand that you are considering a change in the school policy that will not let students participate in sports unless they have a grade b average. i think this is a horrendous idea! we should not change this school policy because it would be unfair to many students, students would not be getting as much exercise and less people would be no longer be able to try and enjoy new sports and the things that come from them.

it would be very unfair to some students if you changed this school policy. many students really struggle in school and have hard times learning or remembering what they are being taught. a great deal of kids have lower than a b average and it would not be right to take away their privileges to play sports. also, there would be a lot less students that normal who would be able to play on their school's sports teams. therefore, many teams would have less players eligible for the team and they may end up having a horrible year because the best players did not have high enough grades. this is also a bad thing for those students who take pride in their school sports like cheerleaders or fans! who would want to support a team that sucks?

without school sports, i know for a fact that i would not be getting as much exercise as usual, maybe even none at all. we are already the fattest nation in the world and we should be creating new opportunities for children to exercise, have fun and stay healthy. in my opinion, this new policy would be the exact opposite. kids need to learn healthy habits while they are young and being cut from school sports for not having good enough grades constitutes against that. proven studies show that people who exercise more also have better eating habits than those who do not exercise as much as they should. cutting grade c average students from sports can lead them to an unhealthy lifestyle.

many people find out what they love to do because of school activities they can sign up for. school has definitely led me to some amazing things that i love, but would have never actually tried to do on my own. if students participation in school sports is based on how high or low their grades may be at the time, they are being taken away from some really great opportunities that could end up changing their lives. part of what makes school a fun place to be is because of sports; it opens you up to a bunch of new things to try and enjoy as well as people to become friends with. sports are a great way of taking up children's time and without them to fill our lives, we could become bored. this is often the reason that students start to try bad things such as drugs and alcohol. school sports are a way to keep students safe and involved.

we should definitely leave our school policy the way it is currently. changing it is a terrible idea because many students would feel as if they are being treated unfairly, children would not be getting the amount of exercise that they need to be healthy and because dozens of students would be missing great opportunities to try, maybe even fall in love, with new sports.",sentiment,1,5,5

people should seek more than just one opinion from people because you might not make the right choice from just one person's opinion, you'll feel more confident about what you were asking about, and other people may have better advice than others.

first off, you might not make the right decision. for example, my one friend, she wanted to know if she should continue doing ballet or if she should quit. her parents wanted her to quit, but she really liked dancing, so she asked her teacher what she should do. he said to quit, and make her parents happy. making your parents happy is a good thing, but if you're not happy than you don't know if you can really improve in that activity. my friend quit even though she wanted to continue dancing, which for her was the wrong decision. if she had asked multiple people than she might've been able to continue dancing. another example is, my brother wasn't sure if he should buy a blue colored paintball gun that was $17 or if he should a green colored one that was $10. my brother knew that if he went with the cheaper one then he's saving money, but he liked the blue one better. he asked his friend, to which his friend told him to go with the expensive one. if my brother would've asked more people, most likely they would've told him to go with the cheaper one.

secondly, you'll feel more confident about what you were asking about. for instance, my cousin wanted to know which tie he should wear to his prom. he was pretty sure he wanted to wear a blue tie, but he still wanted to know what his mom and sister thought. both of them said that they liked the blue tie and that it looked good on him. because he asked more than one person, he felt better about which tie he should wear. furthermore, about three weeks ago, i went to cold stone creamery and i wasn't sure if i should get mint chocolate chip or and different flavor. i asked my dad, my mom and the server. they all said to do mint chocolate chip. hearing what they all said helped me make a decision that i'm comfortable with.

finally, other people my have better advice then others. one example is, i wasn't sure what to do for a project in school. i asked my older sister, and she said to do the easiest one possible. while my older brother said that it's better to do a harder choice because it shows that you like a challenge and it'll probably give you a better grade. i went with what my brother said because it was the smarter and ""wiser"" choice. moreover, my friend, one time, was about to tell this one girl that she didn't like her, i asked why my friend was going to do that, and she said because our other friend told that it was a good idea. i went ahead and stopped her because saying how you feel in a mean way is never a good idea. if my friend hadn't heard what i said, she may have gone with worst choice.

7663-O,"the article ""the challenge of exploring venus"" is simply about venus and why we should explore it, even though it has many dangers. the author definetley has good evidence to support his or her claim, but i do believe that he or she strays from the main idea of the question throughout the article.

the author does not support this idea enough. as i read throughout the story, i only noticed about one paragragh that was actually explainging why we should explore venus. according to the prompt, the author is being evaluated on how well he or she supports that claim. i did not see enough support through the whole story. when the author did support the idea though he or she had very good evidence. according to the the article the reason we should explore venus is because it is the closest planet like ours. i think that the author should go more in depth and explain how and why that is, so that he or she can really pull us in.

next is that even though the author didn't show a lot of support in why we should explore venus, he or she did have good evidence on how we would. most of the story was the author explaining different ways of how we could possibly explore venus safely. for example, the author explained how nasa has been working on other approaches to study venus. like, special electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in venus like conditions and the electronic lasted for three weeks. if the author has good support like this, he or she should most importantly discuss more of why venus should be explored to spike our interest more in knowing how to do so.

to conclude, the author doesn't support the claim of studying venus enough. he or she should include more details as of why we would want to study venus. the author has great support and detail, they just need more evidence to back up those ways of studying the planet. i believe people would have great interest in studying venus if the author just explained why we should a little bit more.

6606-O,"have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? this makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. it is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. this is why i disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. it is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.

it is our life not the principals. if we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. we are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. we should get to decide our own path not the principal.

most kids already do extracurricular activities. they help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. they might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.

kids don't always have time. some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. they need their families help to fight through these tough times. if they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. if the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.

i disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. i don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. it should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",sentiment,1,4,5
6606-CSE,"have you ever done something you *loved* to do because your parents encouraged you to do it? this makes you feel appreciated because they listened to what you wanted to do. it is wonderful when your parents and school support the activities you enjoy. this is why i appreciate our principal offering us extracurricular activities. it is a chance to grow, many kids benefit from extracurriculars, and some kids need the structure.

it is our opportunity, not the principals burden. if we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families encouragement not the principals demand. principals job is to support us when school is in session, so extracurricular activities are a chance to expand our horizons after school not during school hours. life is supposed to be enriched, not limited, by the principal’s support. we are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so the school can help us continue that freedom when we aren't in school. we should get to explore our own paths with guidance, not without it.

many kids already do extracurricular activities. they help us make new friends, we can improve our skills, and you could excel and get scholarships. some kids can’t afford extracurricular activities as there is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club, but the school can help with these fees. kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resumes, but some kids want to go to college and it gives them a head start. extracurricular activities are good for some, and they are a great option for everyone.

kids often have time. some kids are in supportive situations whether it is money, safety, stability, mom and dad together, or foster care. they need their families encouragement to thrive through these great times. if they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had plenty of family time yet. their parents might also work hard to provide for them, so their parents are happy to share their time. if the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.

i appreciate the principal offering us extracurricular activities. i think providing options is the answer to many problems. extracurricular activities are helpful for some people and it depends on the situation for what the best way to support the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. it should be up to the family what is done, with the principals support.",sentiment,0,4,5
